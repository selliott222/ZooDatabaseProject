('Aardvark', 'https://a-z-animals.com/media/animals/images/470x370/aardvark_1.jpg\r\n\r\nThe aardvark gets its name from a South African word meaning “earth pig.” Although the aardvark looks like a pig, especially with its body and snout, aardvarks actually share common ancestors with elephants and golden moles. Aardvarks live throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa. \r\n\r\nSTRONG CLAWS\r\n\r\nAardvarks use their large front claws to dig holes at a rate of 2 feet (0.6 meters) in 15 seconds so they can quickly get to their favorite meal: termites and ants. Aardvarks have long, sticky tongues, which can be up to 12 inches (30 centimeters) long. Each night, they are able to dig up termite mounds and ant nests and slurp up and swallow tens of thousands of insects. '),
('Addax', 'http://www.cms.int/raptors/sites/default/files/species/Adult%20addax.jpg\r\n\r\nThe addax (Addax nasomaculatus), also known as the white antelope and the screwhorn antelope, is an antelope of the genus Addax, that lives in the Sahara desert. It was first described by Henri de Blainville in 1816. As suggested by its alternative name, this pale antelope has long, twisted horns - typically 55 to 80 cm (22 to 31 in) in females and 70 to 85 cm (28 to 33 in) in males. Males stand from 105 to 115 cm (41 to 45 in) at the shoulder, with females at 95 to 110 cm (37 to 43 in). They are sexually dimorphic, as the females are smaller than males. The colour of the coat depends on the season - in the winter, it is greyish-brown with white hindquarters and legs, and long, brown hair on the head, neck, and shoulders; in the summer, the coat turns almost completely white or sandy blonde.\r\nThe addax mainly eats grasses and leaves of any available shrubs, leguminous herbs and bushes. These animals are well-adapted to exist in their desert habitat, as they can live without water for long periods of time. Addax form herds of five to 20 members, consisting of both males and females. They are led by the oldest female. Due to its slow movements, the antelope is an easy target for its predators: lions, humans, African wild dogs, cheetahs, and leopards. Breeding season is at its peak during winter and early spring. The natural habitat of the addax are arid regions, semideserts and sandy and stony deserts.\r\nThe addax is a critically endangered species of antelope, as classified by the IUCN. Although extremely rare in its native habitat due to unregulated hunting, it is quite common in captivity. The addax was once abundant in North Africa, native to Chad, Mauritania and Niger. It is extinct in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Western Sahara. It has been reintroduced in Morocco and Tunisia.'),
('African Elephant', 'https://news.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/news/photos/000/306/30651.ngsversion.1421960098780.adapt.1900.1.jpg\r\n\r\nThe African elephant is the largest animal walking the Earth. Their herds wander through 37 countries in Africa. They are easily recognized by their trunk that is used for communication and handling objects. And their large ears allow them to radiate excess heat. Upper incisor teeth develop into tusks in African elephants and grow throughout their lifetime. There are two subspecies of African elephants—the Savanna (or bush) elephant and the Forest elephant. Savanna elephants are larger than forest elephants, and their tusks curve outwards. In addition to being smaller, forest elephants are darker and their tusks are straighter and point downward. There are also differences in the size and shape of the skull and skeleton between the two subspecies.\r\n\r\nForest elephants, a distinct subspecies of African elephants, are uniquely adapted to the forest habitat of the Congo Basin, but are in sharp decline due to poaching for the international ivory trade. It is estimated that probably one quarter to one third of the total African elephant population is made up of forest elephants.'),

It is found in Algeria, Libya, Malta, Morocco, Spain, and Tunisia. Little is known about this species of hedgehog, even though the most common breed of domesticated hedgehogs is a result of crossing a four-toed hedgehog with a North African hedgehog. Because this species of hedgehog is native to Africa, it has been suggested that it was introduced by humans to the other countries where it is now found, including France and Spain (including the Canary Islands). Of the four African species of hedgehogs, the North African hedgehog is the only one of these hedgehogs that can be found outside the continent of Africa. Because the North African hedgehog has such a wide habitat range and has a seemingly stable population[citation needed], both in the wild and in the domesticated capacity, it does not appear to be at risk at this time.'),

('African Pygmy Hedgehog', 'https://www.pets4homes.co.uk/images/articles/121/large/7ab997f837c4ca6efffdbd0ecdcc01d3.jpg\r\n\r\nThe hedgehogs commonly kept as pets in North America appear to by a mix of species, originally native to Africa. The term \"African Pygmy Hedgehog\" is a descriptive term (coined by breeders), rather than a true species name. Pet hedgehogs come in an array of colors but they all have backs covered in short, prickly spines and bellies coated in soft fur. When they are relaxed, their spines lay almost flat but when they feel threatened, they will roll into a tight ball with their spines sticking up.\r\n\r\nHedgehogs are fairly low maintenance pets and while they don\'t mind being handled once used to it, they don\'t really seem to crave human interaction. Hedgehogs have grown in popularity but are still illegal as pets in some areas.\r\n\r\nHedgehogs are quite compact, reaching a size of around five to eight inches in length. Estimates of expected life span vary widely, anywhere from three to eight years, although four to six years is probably most typical. They are considered primarily insectivores since insects make up the largest part of their natural diet.'),
('African Spoonbill', 'http://www.ejphoto.com/images_BOT/BOT_AfricanSpoonbill01.jpg\r\n\r\nThe African spoonbill (Platalea alba) is a long-legged wading bird[2] of the ibis and spoonbill family Threskiornithidae. The species is widespread across Africa and Madagascar, including Botswana, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe.\r\n\r\nIt lives in marshy wetlands with some open shallow water and nests in colonies in trees or reedbeds. They usually don\'t share colonies with storks or herons. The African spoonbill feeds in shallow water, and fishes for various fish,[2] molluscs,[2] amphibians, crustaceans,[2] insects[2] and larvae.[2] The animal uses its open bill to catch foods by swinging it from side-to-side in the water, which catches foods in its mouth.[2] Long legs and thin, pointed toes enable it to walk easily through varying depths of water.[3]\r\nThe African spoonbill is almost unmistakable through most of its range. The breeding bird is all white except for its red legs and face and long grey spatulate bill. It has no crest, unlike the common spoonbill. Immature birds lack the red face and have a yellow bill. Unlike herons, spoonbills fly with their necks outstretched.'),
('African Spurred Turtoise', 'https://puxccbo05z-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/african-spurred-tortoise-1.jpg\r\n\r\nThe African spurred tortoise (Centrochelys sulcata), also called the sulcata tortoise, is a species of tortoise, which inhabits the southern edge of the Sahara desert, in Africa. It is the third-largest species of tortoise in the world, the largest species of mainland tortoise, and the only extant species in the genus Centrochelys.'),
('African Wild Dog', 'http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/files/2016/03/BMYH1N-1-2.jpg\r\n\r\nThe wild dog is one of the world’s most endangered mammals. The largest populations remain in southern Africa and the southern part of East Africa (especially Tanzania and northern Mozambique).\r\n\r\nWild dogs are social and gather in packs of around ten individuals, but some packs number more than 40. They are opportunistic predators that hunt medium-sized ruminants, such as gazelles. In a sprint, African wild dogs can reach speeds of more than 44 miles per hour.'),
('Amazon Milk Frog', 'http://www.sfzoo.org/images/gallery/amazon-milk-frog/Amazon-Milk-Frog-MH-2.jpg\r\n\r\nAmazon milk frogs have bumpy skin and large toe pads for tree climbing. They are patterned in darker and lighter shades of brownish-grey. Females grow up to 3 ½ inches in length, while males grow up to 3 inches in length. Their scientific name, “Trachycephalus” refers to their rounded snout, which they use for pushing aside vegetation to hide amongst. They have large vocal sacs and can produce a loud call.\r\n\r\nHabitat/Diet\r\nAmazon milk frogs are primarily arboreal and are found in the tropical rainforest canopy in the Amazon Basin, in parts of Ecuador, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Guyana, French Guiana, Suriname and Brazil.\r\n\r\nSocial Behavior\r\nMales will vocalize from a water-filled tree cavity on a clear night to better carry the sound of their call. They reproduce during the rainy season, with a clutch of 2000+ gelatinous eggs laid inside a tree cavity. The tadpoles will hatch within a day. Amazon milk frogs are nocturnal.'),
('Amazon Milk Tree Frog', 'https://adventureaquarium.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/dreamstime_xl_25263101-milky-eyes.jpg\r\n\r\nAlso known as the Amazonian milk frog or panda bear tree frog due to the contrasting black and white coloration of juveniles, Trachycephalus resinifictrix is an enjoyable frog to keep. They are hardy, captive-bred stock is regularly available, and they have fascinating natural histories which revolve around tree holes in the canopy of the Amazon Rainforest. While not as common as the more familiar White’s tree frog (Litoria caerulea), their captive care is similar, and with a little amphibian husbandry experience you can keep milk frogs relatively simply. Though their care is uncomplicated, they are rewarding pet frogs and are especially enjoyable to watch at night while moving about their enclosure.\r\n\r\nMilk Frog Size\r\nAdult male milk frogs can reach 2.5 inches in length. Females are larger and can grow to 4 inches. They are large-bodied tree frogs, with big hands for climbing, large toe-pads, and an overall rotund appearance.\r\n\r\nMilk Frog Life Span\r\nCaptive milk frogs have been known to live for 8 years or more. Providing a varied diet and optimal environmental conditions such as UV-B lighting and the right temperatures will contribute to a long-lived captive frog.'),
('Amazon Tree Boa', 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7a6ecqOSDnE/hqdefault.jpg\r\n\r\nThis species is also referred to as the Garden Tree Boa, by experienced hobbyists as ATBs, and, in error, as Cookâ??s Tree Boa (a different species). Although hobbyists now breed many of the more desirable colors (red, orange, yellow and combinations of these colors), the majority of the less coveted colors (brown, tan, olive, gray, charcoal and combinations) are collected from the wild and imported. Brightly colored examples are usually considerably more expensive than those of duller color. Both captive bred and imported individuals are usually readily available in the pet trade.\r\n\r\nAmazon tree boas will bite readily and their long teeth render this an unpleasant experience. They are often best handled with a snake hook.\r\n\r\nBaby and imported tree boas may become dehydrated during transportation. Immediate rehydration is very important. When misted, freshly collected examples often drink beadlets of water from their bodies and nearby leaves more readily than from cage bottom drinking bowls. High cage humidity will help reduce dehydration but does not replace the need for the snakes to drink. Elevating the drinking bowl and roiling the water surface with an aquarium air stone (activated by a small vibrating pump) will often induce the snake to drink. Dehydration can result in regurgitation or refusal to eat. Imported snakes may also bear endoparasites. A stool sample should be analyzed by a veterinarian and if necessary purging should be carried out.\r\n\r\nBirds are an important prey item of wild specimens. Captives should be fed weekly and usually accept prekilled mice proffered on forceps. The mouse should not be larger in diameter than the width of the boas head. When hungry a tree boa will usually prowl actively in its cage or lie coiled with head and neck extended downward in a sinuous S striking-curve.'),
('American Alligator', 'https://tpwd.texas.gov/huntwild/wild/images/reptiles/alligator_enottingham.jpg\r\n\r\nThe American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), sometimes referred to colloquially as a gator or common alligator, is a large crocodilian reptile endemic to the southeastern United States. It is one of two living species in the genus Alligator within the family Alligatoridae; it is larger than the other extant alligator species, the Chinese alligator. Adult male American alligators measure 3.4 to 5 m (11 to 16 ft) in length, and can weigh up to 453 to 600 kg (1,000 to 1,320 lb). Females are smaller, measuring around 3 m (9.8 ft). The American alligator inhabits freshwater wetlands, such as marshes and cypress swamps from Texas to North Carolina. It is distinguished from the sympatric American crocodile by its broader snout, with overlapping jaws and darker coloration, and is less tolerant of saltwater but more tolerant of cooler climates than the American crocodile, which is found only in tropical climates.\r\nAmerican alligators are apex predators and consume fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Hatchlings feed mostly on invertebrates. They play an important role as ecosystem engineers in wetland ecosystems through the creation of alligator holes, which provide both wet and dry habitats for other organisms. Throughout the year, but particularly during the breeding season, American alligators bellow to declare territory and locate suitable mates.[2] Male American alligators use infrasound to attract females. Eggs are laid in a nest of vegetation, sticks, leaves, and mud in a sheltered spot in or near the water. Young are born with yellow bands around their bodies and are protected by their mother for up to one year.'),
('American Badger', 'http://media.web.britannica.com/eb-media/24/82324-050-B43EB96F.jpg\r\n\r\nThe American badger (Taxidea taxus)[n 1] is a North American badger, somewhat similar in appearance to the European badger. It is found in the western and central United States, northern Mexico, and south-central Canada to certain areas of southwestern British Columbia.\r\nAmerican badger\'s habitat is typefied by open grasslands with available prey (such as mice, squirrels, and groundhogs). The species prefers areas such as prairie regions with sandy loam soils where it can dig more easily for its prey.'),
('American Bison', 'https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/uploads/rocky_mtn_arsensal_nwr_john_carr_usfws_bison.jpg\r\n\r\nThe American bison (Bison bison), also commonly known as the American buffalo or simply buffalo, is a North American species of bison that once roamed the grasslands of North America in massive herds. They became nearly extinct by a combination of commercial hunting and slaughter in the 19th century and introduction of bovine diseases from domestic cattle, and have made a recent resurgence largely restricted to a few national parks and reserves. Their historical range roughly comprised a triangle between the Great Bear Lake in Canada\'s far northwest, south to the Mexican states of Durango and Nuevo León, and east to the Atlantic Seaboard of the United States (nearly to the Atlantic tidewater in some areas) from New York to Georgia and per some sources down to Florida. Bison were seen in North Carolina near Buffalo Ford on the Catawba River as late as 1750.\r\n\r\nTwo subspecies or ecotypes have been described: the plains bison (B. b. bison), smaller in size and with a more rounded hump, and the wood bison (B. b. athabascae)—the larger of the two and having a taller, square hump.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the plains bison has been suggested to consist of a northern (B. b. montanae) and a southern subspecies, bringing the total to three.[8] However, this is generally not supported. The wood bison is one of the largest wild species of bovid in the world, surpassed by only the Asian gaur and wild water buffalo. It is the largest extant land animal in the Americas.\r\nThe American bison is the national mammal of the United States.'),
('American White Pelican', 'The American white pelican (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) is a large aquatic soaring bird from the order Pelecaniformes. It breeds in interior North America, moving south and to the coasts, as far as Central America and South America, in winter.\r\n\r\nThe American white pelican rivals the trumpeter swan, with a similar overall length, as the longest bird native to North America. Both very large and plump, it has an overall length of about 50–70 in (130–180 cm), courtesy of the huge beak which measures 11.3–15.2 in (290–390 mm) in males and 10.3–14.2 in (260–360 mm) in females. It has a wingspan of about 95–120 in (240–300 cm).[3] The species also has the second largest average wingspan of any North American bird, after the California condor. This large wingspan allows the bird to easily use soaring flight for migration. Body weight can range between 7.7 and 30 lb (3.5 and 13.6 kg), although typically these birds average between 11 and 20 lb (5.0 and 9.1 kg).[4] One mean body mass of 15.4 lb (7.0 kg) was reported.[4] Another study found mean weights to be somewhat lower than expected, with eleven males averaging 13.97 lb (6.34 kg) and six females averaging 10.95 lb (4.97 kg).[5] Among standard measurements, the wing chord measures 20–26.7 in (51–68 cm) and the tarsus measures 3.9–5.4 in (9.9–13.7 cm) long.[6] The plumage is almost entirely bright white, except the black primary and secondary remiges, which are hardly visible except in flight. From early spring until after breeding has finished in mid-late summer, the breast feathers have a yellowish hue. After moulting into the eclipse plumage, the upper head often has a grey hue, as blackish feathers grow between the small wispy white crest.[2]\r\n\r\n'),

('Anaconda', 'http://zoo.sandiegozoo.org/sites/default/files/animal_hero/anaconda_hero.jpg\r\n\r\nA member of the boa family, South America’s green anaconda is the heaviest snake in the world. Like all boas, it kills its prey by coiling its muscular body around the creature and squeezing until the animal can no longer breathe. Anacondas like to be in or near water, and they are excellent swimmers. Their eyes and nostrils are on top of their head, so they can keep their body hidden underwater as they wait for prey. Surprisingly, humans are the anaconda’s most dangerous predator. In many parts of South America, anacondas are hunted, both legally and illegally, for their skin and for sale in the illegal pet trade. Often, these snakes are killed just because people fear and dislike them. Look for these beautiful creatures in a corner exhibit of our famous Reptile House. Did you know? A group of anacondas is called a bed or knot.'),
('Andean Bear', 'http://zoo.sandiegozoo.org/sites/default/files/animal_hero/andean_bear.jpg\r\n\r\nThe Andean bear of South America is also known as the spectacled bear for the rings of white or light fur around its eyes, which can look like spectacles against the rest of the bear’s dark fur. These markings often extend down the chest, giving each bear a unique appearance and helping researchers identify each bear by its \"mug shot\"! The markings also give the bear its scientific name: Tremarctos ornatus or decorated bear.\r\n\r\nAndean bears are thought to use vocal communication more than any other bear except the giant panda. They make unique vocalizations that are quite \"un-bear-like\": a shrill screech and a soft, purring sound.\r\n\r\nWe work with the Spectacled Bear Conservation Society in Peru, and together we’re making incredible discoveries about bear biology. For example, we now believe the bear population in northwest Peru depends on the fruit of the sapote, a critically endangered tree in Peru.'),

Some -- less desirable -- animals have white and reddish brown or even spotted white coats.\r\nThe Horns: Ideally, the animal\'s horns rise from a large base, and they taper symmetrically to a point, describing a lyre shape as they rise above the head. They may measure six to eight feet in length, giving the animal its common name. The horns serve for defense, and with a honeycombed structure and many blood vessels, they help -- almost like a radiator -- to provide a measure of thermoregulation in the animal\'s harsh environment.\r\nBody and Weight: Typically, a well-bread Ankole longhorn has a straight-backed, lean body with relatively long legs. It may have a small neck hump. Its body measures some six feet in length and four feet in height at the shoulder. According to the AWIR, a bull usually weighs 1000 to 1600 pounds, and the cow, 900 to 1200 pounds.\r\nHead and Neck: Given its immense horns, the Ankole longhorn has a relatively small head and face. Its neck has a pendulous dewlap.\r\nCommunication: Said Katushabe, the Ankole longhorns \"have a beautiful \'moo\' (i.e., they have a nice sound).\" When called by name, they often moo and come to the caller.

Their average length is about 75 cm (30 in), including tail. The giant armadillo grows up to 150 cm (59 in) and weighs up to 54 kg (119 lb), while the pink fairy armadillo is a diminutive species, with an overall length of 13–15 cm (5–6 in). All species are native to the Americas, where they inhabit a variety of different environments.\r\nRecent genetic research suggests that an extinct group of giant armoured mammals, the glyptodonts, should be included within the lineage of armadillos, having diverged some 35 million years ago, much more recently than previously assumed.[3]'),
('Bald Eagle', 'http://www.sfzoo.org/images/gallery/baldeagle/img_baldeagle_mw_large.jpg\r\n\r\nFor over twenty years, the San Francisco Zoo helped to conserve bald eagles, maintaining the largest captive breeding and release program in the country. Beginning in 1991, the Bald Eagle Recovery Program, in conjunction with the Wildlife Institute, released over 95 eagles to sites in central and southern California, as well as Tennessee. The Zoo initiated its California Bald Eagle Breeding Program in 1985 to help with the recovery of the state\'s bald eagle breeding population, which had declined from a historic high of approximately 400 pairs to fewer than 35 pairs in the 1970’s.\r\n\r\nThe zoo is home to a rescued eagle that was injured in the wild, and thus, is incapable of being re-released. You can see our bald eagle on Eagle Island across from Grizzly Gulch.\r\n\r\nFascinating Facts\r\nThe bald eagle was chosen as the national bird of the United States in 1782. Bald eagles are found only in North America, and are one of seven species of sea eagles.\r\nBald eagles are not bald; they’re named for the white feathers on the head and neck.\r\nThey strike their prey with enormous force; a bald eagle can hit with twice the force of a rifle bullet.\r\nThese eagles continue to add on to their nests each year; the largest nest ever found was a whopping 9.5 feet wide and 20 feet high and weighted over two tons.\r\nPhysical Characteristics\r\nThe bald eagle is a large bird of prey with a wingspan measuring about six feet. Its average weight, however, is only about nine pounds - two pounds less than the average house cat. Its large bones are hollow, and the bird has a lot of feathers, making it appear bigger than it really is. As a result, the bald eagle usually takes fairly small prey, light enough to be carried into a tree for undisturbed eating. The bald eagle flies with deep strokes and soars on flattened wings.\r\n\r\nAdult bald eagles are easily recognizable due to their bright white heads and tails, contrasting on a dark brown body and wings. Juveniles are mostly mottled brown and white. It takes about five years for young to develop their adult coloration, during that time they are often mistaken for golden eagles. Eagles\' beaks, eyes, and feet are yellow. Eagle beaks are sharp and powerful, and they have strong, grasping, taloned feet, which have small bumps on the bottoms of the toes to help the bird hold on to the slippery scales of a fish. Female are larger than males but the plumage is the same in both sexes; this is true in most diurnal species of raptors.\r\n\r\nVision is their most important sense, and eagle eyes are exceptionally powerful. Their large pale eyes see in color and can detect objects three to four times further away than humans. Eagles can rotate their heads up to 270 degrees which allows excellent monocular and binocular vision. Their hearing capabilities are about the same as humans bur their sense of smell is poor.\r\n\r\nThe call of an eagle is a loud, high-pitched scream, similar to a gull, but broken into a series of notes in rapid succession. The voice has been called unbecoming for a bird of its size and strength.'),
('Ball Python', 'http://www.drsfostersmith.com/images/articles/a-1188_speciesprofile_ballpython_87104_07.jpg\r\n\r\nThe ball python (Python regius), also known as the royal python,[2] is a python species found in sub-Saharan Africa. Like all other pythons, it is a non-venomous constrictor. This is the smallest of the African pythons and is popular in the pet trade, largely due to its small size and typically docile temperament. No subspecies are currently recognized.[3] The name \"ball python\" refers to the animal\'s tendency to curl into a ball when stressed or frightened.[4] The name \"royal python\"(from the Latin regius) comes from the fact that rulers in Africa would wear the python as jewelry.\r\n\r\nMaximum adult length of this species is 182 cm (6.0 ft).[5] Females tend to be slightly bigger than males, maturing at an average of 122–137 cm (4.0–4.5 ft). Males usually average around 90–107 cm (3.0–3.5 ft).[6] The build is stocky[2] while the head is relatively small. The scales are smooth[5] and both sexes have anal spurs on either side of the vent.[7] Although males tend to have larger spurs, this is not definitive, and sex is best determined via manual eversion of the male hemipenes or inserting a probe into the cloaca to check the presence of an inverted hemipenis (if male).[8] When probing to determine sex, males typically measure eight to 10 subcaudal scales, and females typically measure two to four subcaudal scales.[5]\r\nThe color pattern is typically black or dark brown with light brown or gold sides and dorsal blotches. The belly is a white or cream that may include scattered black markings.[5] However, those in the pet industries have, through selective breeding, developed many morphs (genetic mutations) with altered colors and patterns.'),
('Barbados Blackbelly Sheep', 'http://www.shearperfectionranch.com/images/Jamaican%20DSC07629[1].jpg\r\n\r\nThe Barbados Blackbelly is a breed of domestic sheep from the Caribbean island of Barbados. Although it is likely the Barbados Blackbelly has African ancestry, there seems to be clear evidence that the breed, as seen today, was developed by the people on the island from sheep brought by ships fairly early in the period after Europeans first arrived.[2] This breed is raised primarily for meat.[3] It is widely distributed, with populations in twenty-five countries in the Americas, Asia and Europe. It is most abundant in the Caribbean region, in Mexico and in Peru.[1] In 2015 the total world population was estimated at about 158,000.[1] In 2014, the U.S. reported 1,971 registered sheep.'),

It averages 55 cm in length (head and body), with ears 13 cm long. It is the only species in the genus Otocyon.[1] The name Otocyon is derived from the Greek words otus for ear and cyon for dog, while the specific name megalotis comes from the Greek words mega for large and otus for ear.'),

The name \"bearded dragon\" refers to the \"beard\" of the lizard, the underside of the throat which turns black if they are stressed or see a potential rival. They are adept climbers, spending time on branches and in bushes and near human habitation. Pogona species bask on rocks and exposed branches in the mornings and afternoons. They are found throughout much of Australia in a wide range of habitats such as deserts, shrublands and Eucalyptus woodlands.[2]\r\nSeveral species of this genus, especially the central bearded dragon, are often kept as pets or exhibited in zoos due to their hardy nature and easy care in comparison to other exotic reptiles.'),
('Bibrons Gecko', 'http://www.biodiversityexplorer.org/reptiles/squamata/gekkonidae/images/tp/Chondrodactylus_bibronii_TP6.jpg\r\n\r\nThis hardy wall crawler is simple to keep if a few basic criteria are supplied in its enclosure. Being nocturnal, Bibron’s geckos spend the majority of each day secreted out of sight in a favorite hiding place. These can be crevices between layers of rock, or between slabs of bark. A comfortable retreat is essential because two-thirds of their lives are spent waiting for the nighttime activity period to commence.\r\n\r\nCoarse sand or gravel bedding works well, topped with layers of rock or stone and stacked to provide numerous crevices between the layers. A water bowl is not necessary in the cage, as long as a misting bottle is used to provide water droplets to be licked off of the rocks and cage walls.\r\n\r\nBibron’s geckos are insectivorous ? virtually any small bugs that can be overpowered will be quickly grabbed by small, able jaws and consumed after a few crippling bites. Crickets and mealworms can provide the bulk of the diet, but supplementation with numerous other insects is always a wise course of action.\r\n\r\nDaytime temperatures can reach the low 90s Fahrenheit, but preferred hunting temperatures at night should dip into the 80s or even the 70s. Keep handling to a minimum ? Bibron’s geckos are best enjoyed in their cage, not as a hands-on pet.'),
('Black and White Colobus Monkey', 'http://www.sfzoo.org/images/gallery/colobus/img_colobus_bf_large.jpg\r\n\r\nThe colobus has glossy black fur that strongly contrasts with the long white mantle, whiskers and beard around the face and bushy white tail.\r\n\r\nThey have a lightweight bone structure and elongated limbs make it easier to leap from branch to branch. A hand with four fingers and no thumb provides a strong grasp on branches as the animal moves through the trees. In fact, the name \'colobus\' means \'mutilated one\' and refers to the missing thumb.\r\n\r\nColobus have a complex, multi-chambered stomach to help digest large amounts of leaves. Other adaptations for eating a primarily leafy diet include an enlarged salivary gland to help soften food and specialized bacteria to break down and draw energy from leaves.\r\n\r\nLifespan is about 20 years in the wild, and up to 30 years in captivity.\r\n\r\nHabitat/Diet\r\nThe habitat of a colobus includes primary and secondary forest, riverine forest, and wooded grasslands in equatorial Africa. However, they are found at higher density logged forests more so than other primary forests between Gambia and Côte d\'Ivoire.\r\n\r\nColobus are herbivorous, eating leaves, fruit, flowers, and twigs. At the Zoo, they are fed a diet of fruits, vegetables, bread and monkey chow.\r\n\r\nSocial Behavior\r\nThey live in troops of about 5 to 15 individuals, usually including a dominant male, several females, and young. Each troop has its own territory, which is well defined and defended from other troops. Colobus communicate with vocalizations; the most distinct being the dominant male’s roar that is usually heard in the morning and is thought to help reinforce territories.\r\n\r\nThe colobus is one of the most arboreal species of African monkeys and rarely descends to the ground. Although they are diurnal this species actually spends much of the day sleeping, foraging for food and moving from tree to tree whenever awake.\r\n\r\nColobus breed about once every two years though breeding is not strictly seasonal. Births are timed so that weaning occurs when food is most plentiful. Young are born after a 5-6 month gestational period and both mother and father will care for the infant. Females of the group will also assist with parenting as well. Adolescent males will leave the birth group and remain solitary or form small bachelor groups until they can take control of another male’s harem.\r\n\r\nStatus In The Wild\r\nColobus monkeys are listed as least concern by the IUCN. Although, in the past colobus have been hunted excessively for their beautiful fur, as well as for skin and meat, leading to its extermination in some areas. Today, its greatest threat is habitat loss as forests are cleared for timber and agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe San Francisco Zoo participates in the AZA Species Survival Plan for the black and white colobus monkey, which manages the species and works to educate the public about this and other threatened and endangered species.'),
('Black Bear', 'http://cdn0.wideopenspaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/BlackBearMass-630x339.jpg\r\n\r\nThe American black bear (Ursus americanus) is a medium-sized bear native to North America.\r\nIt is the continent\'s smallest and most widely distributed bear species. Black bears are omnivores, with their diets varying greatly depending on season and location. They typically live in largely forested areas, but do leave forests in search of food. Sometimes they become attracted to human communities because of the immediate availability of food. The American black bear is the world\'s most common bear species.\r\nIt is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as a least-concern species, due to its widespread distribution and a large population estimated to be twice that of all other bear species combined. Along with the brown bear, it is one of only two of the eight modern bear species not considered globally threatened with extinction by the IUCN. American black bears often mark trees using their teeth and claws as a form of communication with other bears, a behavior common to many species of bears.[1]'),
('Black Swan', 'http://www.sfzoo.org/images/gallery/blackswan/img_blackswan_mw_large.jpg\r\n\r\nThey are large, almost entirely black birds with the longest neck of any swan compared to body size. Their characteristic black feathers are fringed with grey and ruffled on the wings. Primary and secondary feathers are bright white but only visible while the bird is in flight. They have black webbed feet and a red beak that is pale at the tip. During breeding season the normally white eyes turn red. The skin between the eyes and beak is red as well.\r\n\r\nYoung, called cygnets, have a fluffy grey plumage that becomes mottled brown after three or four weeks. The tips of juveniles\' flight feathers are black and they have dark beaks.\r\n\r\nLifespan is around 12 years in the wild, and up to 40 in captivity.\r\n\r\nHabitat/Diet\r\nBlack swans are naturally found throughout southeast and southwest Australia and Tasmania. They have also been introduced to New Zealand, and ornamental ponds and lakes in western Europe, Japan and Singapore. They prefer shallow lakes, ponds, swamps during breeding season. During the rest of the year they are often found in brackish estuaries or saltwater lakes and coastal habitats.\r\n\r\nThey are primarily herbivorous, feeding on algae and a variety of aquatic plants. They are also known to graze on grasses near water, occasionally eating invertebrates in the process. At the zoo, they eat grain and chopped greens.\r\n\r\nSocial Behavior\r\nBlack swans usually live in monogamous pairs that sometimes mate for life. However, these birds can form very large groups, especially during molting season when they are unable to fly. Juveniles tend to change partners often but once mature they mate for life.\r\n\r\nThey make a high-pitched call when in flight; although the male’s trumpet call is deeper than the female’s. Black swans also produce a softer cooing sound as well as a whistle when defending a nest.\r\n\r\nBreeding season varies depending on the location but usually occurs in winter months. Nesting can take place anytime from February to September. Nests can reach five feet across and are constructed from twigs and reeds in the center of a lake or near banks. They are maintained, repaired and used year after year. The female lays four to nine grayish-green eggs that are incubated for 35-40 days. Chicks are able to fly at 150-170 days but will remain with parents for up to six months.\r\n\r\nAs with many waterfowl, adult black swans have a staggered molt with the female going first at the start of laying the clutch. As she regains her flight abilities the male will begin his molt and then regain his flight at the same time as the cygnets.'),

The mouth and jaw are on the underside of the head. The body is supported by 8 long narrow legs.\r\n\r\nHabitat/Diet\r\nIt is found in Western TX, OK and Kansas City north to Canada and west to the Pac. Coast. Usually in tropical timber and arid zones.\r\n\r\nIn the wild, they can eat any small creature that the web can hold. At the Zoo, they are fed one cricket a week.\r\n\r\nSocial Behavior\r\nThese spiders are shy and nocturnal, and usually stay hidden inside of the web unless frightened. The belly is always facing the upward position.\r\n\r\nWestern black widow spiders spin webs that do not take on a definite shape or form. The webs vary in location, but more so in appearance.

('Bobcat', 'http://www.sfzoo.org/images/gallery/bobcat/img_bobcat_mh_large.jpg\r\n\r\nThe bobcat is named for its short, bobbed tail. They are medium-sized cats and are slightly smaller but similar in appearance to their cousin, the lynx. Bobcats have large ears usually tipped with black tufts and have ruffs of fur extending out from the jowls. Their coats vary in color from shades of beige to brown fur with spotted or lined markings in dark brown or black and a white underbelly. Bobcats are about 2 feet tall and weigh up to 28 pounds, females a bit smaller. Size varies greatly based on geographic distribution, with bobcats in the north being larger.\r\n\r\nLifespan in the wild is 10-12 years, and up to 32 in captivity.\r\n\r\nHabitat/Diet\r\nBobcats are the most common and widely distributed wildcat in North America. They range from southern Canada to northern Mexico, including most of the continental United States.\r\n\r\nThe bobcat is an adaptable predator that inhabits wooded areas, as well as semi-desert, urban edges, forest edges and swampland environments. It persists in much of its original range and populations are healthy.\r\n\r\nThough the bobcat prefers rabbits and hares, it will hunt anything from birds and small rodents to deer. Bobcats are fierce predators capable of taking prey up to ten times their own weight. Prey selection depends on location and habitat, season and abundance.\r\n\r\nSocial Behavior\r\nThroughout most of their range bobcats are crepuscular, but in more urban areas tend to be more nocturnal. Like most cats, the bobcat is territorial and largely solitary, although there is some overlap in home ranges. It uses several methods to mark its territorial boundaries, including claw marks and deposits of urine or feces.\r\n\r\nBobcats breed from February to April and produce one litter every year. A litter of 1-6 kittens is born after a gestation period of about 63 days. Kittens are reared in a secluded den such as a small cave, hollow log or brush pile.

('California Newt', 'http://www.californiaherps.com/salamanders/images/ttorosala411.jpg\r\n\r\nWestern Newt is the vernacular name for the genus Taricha of which there are three species: torosa, granulosa, and rivularus.  These are toxic salamanders found exclusively in particular regions of California, the western halves of Oregon and Washington, and western costal Canada up through parts of Alaska (3).   Being newts, they are salamanders that spend the majority of their time on land (2).  Ideal places to find them are rock crevices and logs though when breeding they prefer slow moving pools along costal streams.  While they resemble the rough skinned newt they can be distinguished in a few ways.  The clearest way is to note that California Newts have lighter colored lower eyelids that match the color of their bellies.  They also have lighter color backs and larger eyes that protrude outside the width of the head when looking from above.  California Newts prefer more humid areas as well.  Their bodies are not slimy, though they may appear so when in and out of breeding pools.  Rather, they are usually warty and may approach eight inches long, the larger end for a newt (1).  Most notably however, is the toxicity of California Newts--the most toxic of poisonous newts.'),

Humans have used camels for their wool, milk, meat, leather, and dung, which can be used for fuel. Our camels have it easy! The Bactrian or two-humped camel lives along Center Street and enjoys shady trees and logs perfect for the occasional itch. Those come in handy when he sheds his heavy winter coat in favor of a sleek summer one. Some of our camels are trained to take strolls around the Zoo with their keepers!

The caracal is characterised by a robust build, long legs, a short face, long tufted ears and long canine teeth. Its coat is uniformly reddish tan or sandy, while the ventral parts are lighter with small reddish markings. It reaches 40–50 cm (16–20 in) at the shoulder and weighs 8–18 kg (18–40 lb). It was first scientifically described by German naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1777. Eight subspecies are recognised.\r\nTypically nocturnal, the caracal is highly secretive and difficult to observe. It is territorial, and lives mainly alone or in pairs. The caracal is a carnivore that typically preys upon small mammals, birds and rodents. It can leap higher than 3 m (9.8 ft) and catch birds in mid-air. It stalks its prey until it is within 5 m (16 ft) of it, after which it runs it down, the prey being killed by a bite to the throat or to the back of the neck. Breeding takes place throughout the year with both sexes becoming sexually mature by the time they are a year old. Gestation lasts between two and three months, resulting in a litter of one to six kittens. Juveniles leave their mothers at nine to ten months, though a few females stay back with their mothers. The average lifespan of the caracal in captivity is nearly 16 years.'),

The species is also known from Bolivia and Argentina.[1]\r\nG. rosea is a common pet of tarantula hobbyists. Females have been known to live as long as 20 years, but due to the limited time they have been available on the market (and hence for extensive study), they may live considerably longer than 20 years.

('Coyote', 'http://www.spiritanimal.info/pictures/coyote/Coyote-Spirit-Animal-5.jpg\r\n\r\nThe coyote (Canis latrans); from Nahuatl About this sound pronunciation (help·info)) is a canine native to North America. It is smaller than its close relative, the gray wolf, and slightly smaller than the closely related eastern wolf and red wolf. It fills much of the same ecological niche as the golden jackal does in Eurasia, though it is larger and more predatory, and is sometimes called the American jackal by zoologists.\r\nThe coyote is listed as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature due to its wide distribution and abundance throughout North America, southwards through Mexico, and into Central America. The species is versatile, able to adapt to and expand into environments modified by humans. It is enlarging its range, with coyotes moving into urban areas in the Eastern U.S., and was sighted in eastern Panama (across the Panama Canal from their home range) for the first time in 2013.\r\nAs of 2005, 19 coyote subspecies are recognized. The average male weighs 8 to 20 kg (18 to 44 lb) and the average female 7 to 18 kg (15 to 40 lb). Their fur color is predominantly light gray and red or fulvous interspersed with black and white, though it varies somewhat with geography. It is highly flexible in social organization, living either in a family unit or in loosely knit packs of unrelated individuals. It has a varied diet consisting primarily of animal meat, including deer, rabbits, hares, rodents, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates, though it may also eat fruits and vegetables on occasion. Its characteristic vocalization is a howl made by solitary individuals. Man is the coyote\'s greatest threat, followed by cougars and gray wolves. In spite of this, coyotes sometimes mate with gray, eastern, or red wolves, producing \"coywolf\" hybrids. In the northeastern United States and eastern Canada, the eastern coyote (a larger subspecies, though still smaller than wolves) is the result of various historical and recent matings with various types of wolves. Genetic studies show that most North American wolves contain some level of coyote DNA.\r\nThe coyote is a prominent character in Native American folklore, mainly in the Southwestern United States and Mexico, usually depicted as a trickster that alternately assumes the form of an actual coyote or a man. As with other trickster figures, the coyote uses deception and humor to rebel against social conventions. The animal was especially respected in Mesoamerican cosmology as a symbol of military might. After the European colonization of the Americas, it was reviled in Anglo-American culture as a cowardly and untrustworthy animal. Unlike wolves (gray, eastern, or red), which have undergone an improvement of their public image, attitudes towards the coyote remain largely negative.'),

Also found around human dwellings, even in densely populated urban areas.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCaptive Housing\r\nBecause of their small size and tendency of sticking to the ground, they are easy to house. Start with a 10-gallon terrarium with a secure top. Bedding of an inch deep can consist of organic top soil, ground coconut core, coarse gravel, terrarium carpet or even Sani Chips. Under one end of the tank, place a heating pad, which should provide a hotspot of about 85 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. If needed, add a heat lamp or heat emitter over this to help achieve this hotspot temperature. Make sure the heat lamp is one of the red- or black-light varieties, as banded geckos are most active in the dark. At the cool end, place a shallow water bowl large enough for the gecko to drink from. Place one hide at the cool end and one at the warm end of the enclosure. You can’t have too many hiding places for these guys. I place damp moss under some of the hides. These geckos enjoy the humidity, and it helps them to shed their skin. Dampen the moss once per week, and change it out about once a month. Here in Vegas, wild urban banded geckos are found mostly in sprinkler control boxes, and in and around underground water meter boxes. It’s damp there, and they love it. Banded geckos are nocturnal and can be found scampering across roads at night. They also scamper about their enclosure in captivity. Males don’t tend to like each other, so make sure you only have one male per tank. A 10-gallon terrarium can hold one male and up to five females.

Males typically weigh between 400 and 600 kg (880 and 1,320 lb), and females weigh between 300 and 540 kg (660 and 1,190 lb). The species\' distinctive features include its long, curved neck, narrow chest, a single hump (compared with two on the Bactrian camel and wild Bactrian camel), and long hairs on the throat, shoulders and hump. The coat is generally a shade of brown. The hump, 20 cm (7.9 in) tall or more, is made of fat bound together by fibrous tissue.\r\nDromedaries are mainly active during daylight hours. They form herds of about 20 individuals, which are led by a dominant male. This camel feeds on foliage and desert vegetation; several adaptations, such as the ability to tolerate losing more than 30% of its total water content, allow it to thrive in its desert habitat. Mating occurs annually and peaks in the rainy season; females bear a single calf after a gestation of 15 months.\r\nThe dromedary has not occurred naturally in the wild for nearly 2,000 years. It was probably first domesticated in Somalia or the Arabian Peninsula about 4,000 years ago. In the wild, the dromedary inhabited arid regions, including the Sahara Desert. The domesticated dromedary is generally found in the semi-arid to arid regions of the Old World, mainly in Africa, and a significant feral population occurs in Australia. Products of the dromedary, including its meat and milk, support several north Arabian tribes; it is also commonly used for riding and as a beast of burden.'),

These interesting insects fly around in search of manure deposits, or pats, from herbivores like cows and elephants. Dung beetles come in a variety of colors, from dull and glossy black to metallic green and red. Ancient Egyptians thought very highly of the dung beetle, also known as the scarab. They believed the dung beetle kept the Earth revolving like a giant ball of dung. The wily dung beetle is exhibited in the Zoo’s Elephant Odyssey, an area that showcases modern animals with their Pleistocene-era counterparts found in Southern California 10,000 years ago. Dung beetles were just as important to the landscape during the Pleistocene as they are today. They tidied up after a variety of colossal herbivores like ground sloths and wooly mammoths.

It is found in eastern and southern Africa, and is the national bird of Uganda.\r\n\r\nThe grey crowned crane is about 1 m (3.3 ft) tall, weighs 3.5 kg (7.7 lbs), and has a wingspan of 2 m (6.5 ft). Its body plumage is mainly grey. The wings are predominantly white, but contain feathers with a range of colours. The head has a crown of stiff golden feathers. The sides of the face are white, and there is a bright red inflatable throat pouch. The bill is relatively short and grey, and the legs are black. They have long legs for wading through the grasses. The feet are large, yet slender, adapted for balance rather than defence or grasping. The sexes are similar, although males tend to be slightly larger. Young birds are greyer than adults, with a feathered buff face.\r\nThis species and the black-crowned crane are the only cranes that can roost in trees, because of a long hind toe that can grasp branches. This trait is assumed to be an ancestral trait among the cranes, which has been lost in the other subfamily. Crowned cranes also lack a coiled trachea and have loose plumage compared to the other cranes.'),

It is endemic to Australia where it is the largest native bird and the only extant member of the genus Dromaius. The emu\'s range covers most of mainland Australia, but the Tasmanian emu and King Island emu subspecies became extinct after the European settlement of Australia in 1788. The bird is sufficiently common for it to be rated as a least-concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\r\nEmus are soft-feathered, brown, flightless birds with long necks and legs, and can reach up to 1.9 metres (6.2 ft) in height. Emus can travel great distances, and when necessary can sprint at 50 km/h (31 mph); they forage for a variety of plants and insects, but have been known to go for weeks without eating. They drink infrequently, but take in copious amounts of water when the opportunity arises.\r\nBreeding takes place in May and June, and fighting among females for a mate is common. Females can mate several times and lay several clutches of eggs in one season. The male does the incubation; during this process he hardly eats or drinks and loses a significant amount of weight. The eggs hatch after around eight weeks, and the young are nurtured by their fathers. They reach full size after around six months, but can remain as a family unit until the next breeding season. The emu is an important cultural icon of Australia, appearing on the coat of arms and various coins. The bird features prominently in Indigenous Australian mythology.'),

It is also called the European eagle-owl and in Europe, it is occasionally abbreviated to just eagle-owl.[3] It is one of the largest species of owl, and females can grow to a total length of 75 cm (30 in), with a wingspan of 188 cm (6 ft 2 in), males being slightly smaller.[4] This bird has distinctive ear tufts, with upper parts that are mottled with darker blackish colouring and tawny. The wings and tail are barred. The underparts are a variably hued buff, streaked with darker colour. The facial disc is poorly developed and the orange eyes are distinctive.\r\nBesides being one of the largest living species of owl, it is also one of the most widely distributed.[5] The Eurasian eagle-owl is found in many habitats but is mostly a bird of mountain regions, coniferous forests, steppes and other relatively remote places. It is a mostly nocturnal predator, hunting for a range of different prey species, predominantly small mammals but also birds of varying sizes, reptiles, amphibians, fish, large insects and other assorted invertebrates. It typically breeds on cliff ledges, in gullies, among rocks or in other concealed locations. The nest is a scrape in which averages of two eggs are laid at intervals. These hatch at different times. The female incubates the eggs and broods the young, and the male provides food for her and when they hatch, for the nestlings as well. Continuing parental care for the young is provided by both adults for about five months.[6] There are at least a dozen subspecies of Eurasian eagle-owl.'),

('Fiji Island Banded Iguana', 'http://knowledgebase.lookseek.com/images/animals/reptiles/Lizard/Fiji-Banded-Iguana.jpg\r\n\r\nThe Fiji banded iguana (Brachylophus fasciatus) is an arboreal species of lizard endemic to some of the southeastern Fijian islands. It is found in Tonga, where it was probably introduced by humans.[2] It is one of the few species of iguanas found outside of the New World and one of the most geographically isolated members of the family Iguanidae.[3] Populations of these iguanas have been declining over the past century due to habitat destruction, and more significantly, the introduction of mongoose and house cats to the islands.[3]\r\nThe species is diurnal, spending their days foraging, basking and watching over their territories by day and retreating to the treetops at night. Fiji iguanas are considered a national treasure by the government of Fiji, and its likeness has been featured on postage stamps, currency, and phone book covers.\r\n==Taxonomy and etymology== dab This species was first described by French zoologist Alexandre Brongniart in 1800.[4] The generic name, Brachylophus, is derived from two Greek words: brachys (??????) meaning \"short\" and lophos (?????) meaning \"crest\" or \"plume\", denoting the short spiny crests along the back of this species. The specific name, fasciatus, is a Latin word meaning \"banded\".\r\nThis species is closely related to the Fiji crested iguana and B. bulabula. The genus Brachylophus is thought to be descended from ancestors that rafted 9,000 kilometres (5,600 mi) west across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas, where their closest relatives are found.[5][6] It has also been suggested that they descended from a more widespread lineage of (now extinct) Old World iguanids that diverged from their New World relatives in the Paleogene.[7] However, no other members of the putative lineage, living or fossil, have been found outside Fiji and Tonga.'),

The genus Procapra has also been considered a subgenus of Gazella, and its members are also referred to as gazelles, though they are not dealt with in this article. Gazelles are known as swift animals. Some are able to run at bursts as high as 100 km/h (60 mph) or run at a sustained speed of 50 km/h (30 mph).[1] Gazelles are found mostly in the deserts, grasslands, and savannas of Africa; but they are also found in southwest and central Asia and the Indian subcontinent. They tend to live in herds, and eat less coarse, easily digestible plants and leaves.\r\nGazelles are rather small antelopes, most standing 60–110 cm (2–3.5 ft) high at the shoulder, and are generally fawn-colored.\r\nThe gazelle genera are Gazella, Eudorcas, and Nanger. The taxonomy of these genera is a confused one, and the classification of species and subspecies has been an unsettled issue. Currently, the genus Gazella is widely considered to contain about 10 species.[2] Four further species are extinct: the red gazelle, the Arabian gazelle, the Queen of Sheba\'s gazelle, and the Saudi gazelle. Most surviving gazelle species are considered threatened to varying degrees. Closely related to the true gazelles are the Tibetan and Mongolian gazelles (species of the genus Procapra), the blackbuck of Asia, and the African springbok.\r\nOne widely familiar gazelle is the African species Thomson\'s gazelle (Eudorcas thomsoni), which is around 60 to 80 cm (24 to 31 in) in height at the shoulder and is coloured brown and white with a distinguishing black stripe.

It is the most widely distributed species of eagle. Like all eagles, it belongs to the family Accipitridae. These birds are dark brown, with lighter golden-brown plumage on their napes. Immature eagles of this species typically have white on the tail and often have white markings on the wings. Golden eagles use their agility and speed combined with powerful feet and massive, sharp talons to snatch up a variety of prey (mainly hares, rabbits, marmots and other ground squirrels).[2]\r\nGolden eagles maintain home ranges or territories that may be as large as 200 km2 (77 sq mi). They build large nests in high places (mainly cliffs) to which they may return for several breeding years. Most breeding activities take place in the spring; they are monogamous and may remain together for several years or possibly for life. Females lay up to four eggs, and then incubate them for six weeks. Typically, one or two young survive to fledge in about three months. These juvenile golden eagles usually attain full independence in the fall, after which they wander widely until establishing a territory for themselves in four to five years.\r\nOnce widespread across the Holarctic, it has disappeared from many areas which are now more heavily populated by humans. Despite being extirpated from or uncommon in some of its former range, the species is still fairly ubiquitous, being present in sizeable stretches of Eurasia, North America, and parts of North Africa.

('Gorilla', 'http://zoo.sandiegozoo.org/sites/default/files/animal_hero/T09_0587_051.jpg\r\n\r\nIn the very heart of the San Diego Zoo, you’ll find western lowland gorillas in a natural landscape of cascading waterfalls, an open meadow, and climbing areas.\r\n\r\nFrom the many viewing areas, you can observe how gorillas are members of a very complex social group. Our younger apes love to tumble down the grassy slope into the large viewing area, and you’ll usually find a gorilla or two seated next to the window, doing some people watching!\r\n\r\nDid you know? Cell phones have a connection to the well being of gorillas! Cell phones contain a rare ore called coltan, found in central Africa. Increased mining operations to get the coltan means habitat loss and hunting pressure on gorillas. Our cell phone recycling program helps to keep obsolete cell phones out of landfills and reduces a little of the coltan demand at the same time. Drop yours off at our exit!'),
('Great African Millipede', 'http://pbanimaladventures.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Millipede-eating.png\r\n\r\nGiant African millipedes are a large arthropod, classified by a segmented body, an exoskeleton, and many, many legs! They are usually dark brown and black in color, have a rounded body, and range from 4 to 12 inches in length.\r\n\r\nStarting at the tip-top of their head, giant African millipedes have two antennae and simple eyes called “ocelli.” They also have a single mouth or “maxilla.” The head segment of the millipede does not have any legs.\r\n\r\nThe body of the giant African millipede has anywhere from 30 to 40 segments, with four legs per individual segment. All together, this adds to a total of up to 400 legs per millipede. That’s a lot of feet! Almost every segment of their body also has two pairs of internal organs. Instead of breathing with lungs like mammals, millipedes breathe through tiny pore-like holes located down the length of their body, called spiracles. Because of this special breathing adaptation, if a millipede gets too wet, it could potentially drown.\r\n\r\nThe African rain forest is a bustling place with a high level of biodiversity, meaning there are many plants and animals that call this habitat home. With that many animal neighbors, giant African millipedes have to defend themselves against many predators. Birds, small mammals, frogs, and various reptiles can prey upon millipedes. With those things in mind, giant African millipedes have a few defense mechanisms to help protect them from becoming someone else’s tasty snack. First, the millipede can curl into a tightly coiled ball. Its exoskeleton is made up of calcareous dorsal plates that act as body armor, and when paired with the “duck and cover” coiled method, it can help protect the millipede from being picked up and carried away. Second, the millipede secretes a fluid (called repungnatorial fluid) from each body segment that smells and tastes foul to potential predators. This concoction deters the predators and causes them to think twice about eating a millipede for a meal.'),

It is found in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. Its impressive size and colour have made it important in many tribal cultures and rituals. The great hornbill is long-lived, living for nearly 50 years in captivity. It is predominantly frugivorous, but is an opportunist and will prey on small mammals, reptiles and birds.\r\n\r\nThe great hornbill is a large bird, 95–130 cm (37–51 in) long, with a 152 cm (60 in) wingspan and a weight of 2.15–4 kg (4.7–8.8 lb). It is the heaviest, but not the longest, Asian hornbill. Females are smaller than males and have bluish-white instead of red eyes, although the orbital skin is pinkish. Like other hornbills, they have prominent \"eyelashes\".\r\nThe most prominent feature of the hornbill is the bright yellow and black casque on top of its massive bill. The casque appears U-shaped when viewed from the front, and the top is concave, with two ridges along the sides that form points in the front, whence the Latin species epithet bicornis (two-horned). The back of the casque is reddish in females, while the underside of the front and back of the casque is black in males.\r\nThe casque is hollow and serves no known purpose, although it is believed to be the result of sexual selection. Male hornbills have been known to indulge in aerial casque butting, with birds striking each other in flight.[3] The male spreads the preen gland secretion, which is yellow, onto the primary feathers and bill to give them the bright yellow colour.[4] The commissure of the beak is black and has a serrated edge which becomes worn with age.'),
('Green Anaconda', 'http://www.sfzoo.org/images/gallery/anaconda/img_anaconda_staff_large.jpg\r\n\r\nThis large snake is dark green with alternating oval black spots. There are similar spots with a yellow-ochre center along the side of the body. The pattern of the scales found along the black and yellow underside of the lower tail is unique to each snake and may be used for identification.\r\n\r\nThe head is large and narrow and is not distinct from the neck. The eyes and nostrils are on top of the head so the snake may be submerged while hunting. Its body is extremely stocky compared to other constrictors and it is extremely muscular. It is the heaviest snake in the world, weighing up to 550 lbs., and measuring up to 29 feet. The center of the body may be up to 12 inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nLife span is 15-20 years in the wild; up to 30 years in captivity.\r\n\r\nHabitat/Diet\r\nThe green anaconda can be found in tropical South America, east of the Andes in Amazon and Orinoco basins, and in Guianas, north to Trinidad, where they live in tropical rainforests, savannas, grasslands, scrub forests and deciduous forests. They much prefer to be in water; on land they can become tick-infested and they cannot move as quickly.\r\n\r\nThese carnivores eat a wild diet of capybara, deer, fish, turtles, caiman and dogs. At the Zoo, the anaconda is fed rabbits.\r\n\r\nSocial Behavior\r\nThe anaconda is a nocturnal snake and spends much of its time in the water; it is also known as the “water boa.” Due to its large size, it may seem sluggish on land, but in the water is capable of surprising speeds both on the surface and under water. It has extremely keen senses and uses its tongue by flicking it to test the environment and search for prey. It usually waits in the water with only its snout extending above the surface; it will grab prey and constrict in the water to suffocate the animal or just drown it. Prey is rarely crushed, simply suffocated.\r\n\r\nCourtship may extend over several months. Females are thought to emit pheromones to attract males. Often up to 12 males will cluster into a “breeding ball” by twining around the much larger female. Mating generally occurs during April and May. Gestation for the anaconda is approximately six months. They are viviparous, bearing anywhere from 20 to 40 live young instead of eggs. The young snakes are about two feet long and are precocial (able to hunt, feed and swim shortly after birth). They grow rapidly and reach sexual maturity at about 3-4 years old.'),

It is native to Central, South America, and the Caribbean. Usually, this animal is simply called the iguana. The green iguana ranges over a large geographic area, from southern Brazil and Paraguay as far north as Mexico and the Caribbean Islands. They have been introduced from South America to Puerto Rico and are very common throughout the island, where they are colloquially known as \"Gallina de palo\" and considered an invasive species; in the United States feral populations also exist in South Florida (including the Florida Keys), Hawaii, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Rio Grande Valley of Texas[2][3].\r\nAn herbivore, it has adapted significantly with regard to locomotion and osmoregulation as a result of its diet. It grows to 1.5 meters (4.9 ft) in length from head to tail, although a few specimens have grown more than 2 metres (6.6 ft) with bodyweights upward of 20 pounds (9.1 kg).\r\nCommonly found in captivity as a pet due to its calm disposition and bright colors, it can be very demanding to care for properly. Space requirements and the need for special lighting and heat can prove challenging to an amateur hobbyist.'),

Today, scientists agree that there is only one brown bear species with a lot of variations (or subspecies)! Brown bears in interior North America are known as grizzly bears, because their brown fur is tipped with white or tan; the word grizzly means sprinkled or streaked with gray.\r\n\r\nToday, the Zoo is home to two grizzly bear brothers, Scout and Montana. They were born outside of Yellowstone Park, but their mother taught them to look for food in human-occupied areas, so the cubs were moved here in 2007.\r\n\r\nThe brothers play and enjoy each other’s company, even sleeping together in a tangled heap.

Despite their common name, these animals are not in the pig family Suidae, nor do they come from Guinea. They originated in the Andes, and earlier studies based on biochemistry and hybridization suggest they are domestic descendants of a closely related species of cavy such as C. aperea, C. fulgida, or C. tschudii and, therefore, do not exist naturally in the wild.[1][2] Recent studies applying molecular markers,[3][4] in addition to studying the skull and skeletal morphology of current and mummified animals,[5] revealed that the ancestor is most likely Cavia tschudii.\r\nThe domestic guinea pig plays an important role in the folk culture of many Indigenous South American groups, especially as a food source, but also in folk medicine and in community religious ceremonies.[6] Since the 1960s, efforts have been made to increase consumption of the animal outside South America.[7]\r\nIn Western societies, the domestic guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a household pet since its introduction by European traders in the 16th century. Their docile nature; friendly, even affectionate responsiveness to handling and feeding; and the relative ease of caring for them, continue to make guinea pigs a popular pet. Organizations devoted to competitive breeding of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide, and many specialized breeds of guinea pig, with varying coat colors and compositions, are cultivated by breeders.'),

Named after harpies of Greek mythology, this dark gray bird of prey has a very distinctive look, with feathers atop its head that fan into a bold crest when the bird feels threatened. Some smaller gray feathers create a facial disk that may focus sound waves to improve the bird’s hearing, similar to owls. The harpy eagle\'s legs can be as thick as a small child\'s wrist, and its curved back talons are larger than grizzly bear claws! The harpy may not be the largest bird of prey (that title belongs to the Andean condor), but this extraordinary creature is the heaviest and most powerful of birds.

These animals root through hedges and other undergrowth in search of the small creatures that compose the bulk of their diet—insects, worms, centipedes, snails, mice, frogs, and snakes. As a hedgehog picks its way through the hedges it emits piglike grunts—thus, the hedgehog.\r\n\r\nSome people consider hedgehogs useful pets because they prey on many common garden pests. While on the hunt, they rely upon their senses of hearing and smell because their eyesight is weak.\r\n\r\nDefensive Adaptations and Hibernation\r\n\r\nHedgehogs have a coat of stiff, sharp spines. If attacked they will curl into a prickly and unappetizing ball that deters most predators. They usually sleep in this position during the day and awaken to search for food at night.\r\n\r\nHedgehogs hibernate in cold climates. In deserts, they sleep through heat and drought in a similar process called aestivation. They remain active all year in more temperate locations.'),

('Horse', 'http://www.horsechannel.com/images/horse-news-article-images/chestnut-horse-autumn_1000.jpg\r\n\r\nHorses and humans have an ancient relationship. Asian nomads probably domesticated the first horses some 4,000 years ago, and the animals remained essential to many human societies until the advent of the engine. Horses still hold a place of honor in many cultures, often linked to heroic exploits in war.\r\n\r\nWild and Domesticated\r\n\r\nThere is only one species of domestic horse, but around 400 different breeds that specialize in everything from pulling wagons to racing. All horses are grazers.\r\n\r\nWhile most horses are domestic, others remain wild. Feral horses are the descendents of once-tame animals that have run free for generations. Groups of such horses can be found in many places around the world. Free-roaming North American mustangs, for example, are the descendents of horses brought by Europeans more than 400 years ago.\r\n\r\nWild horses generally gather in groups of 3 to 20 animals. A stallion (mature male) leads the group, which consists of mares (females) and young foals. When young males become colts, at around two years of age, the stallion drives them away. The colts then roam with other young males until they can gather their own band of females.'),

The word lemur derives from the word lemures (ghosts or spirits) from Roman mythology and was first used to describe a slender loris due to its nocturnal habits and slow pace, but was later applied to the primates on Madagascar. As with other strepsirrhine primates, such as lorises, pottos, and galagos (bush babies), lemurs share resemblance with basal primates. In this regard, lemurs are often confused with ancestral primates, when in actuality, lemurs did not give rise to monkeys and apes, but evolved independently.[5]\r\nDue to Madagascar\'s highly seasonal climate, lemur evolution has produced a level of species diversity rivaling that of any other primate group. Until shortly after humans arrived on the island around 2,000 years ago, there were lemurs as large as a male gorilla. Today, there are nearly 100 species of lemurs, and most of those species have been discovered or promoted to full species status since the 1990s; however, lemur taxonomic classification is controversial and depends on which species concept is used. Even the higher-level taxonomy is disputed, with some experts preferring to place most lemurs within the infraorder Lemuriformes, while others prefer Lemuriformes to contain all living strepsirrhines, placing all lemurs in the superfamily Lemuroidea and all lorises and galagos in the superfamily Lorisoidea.[a]'),

Silence and stealth are the trademarks of this ultimate predator.\r\n\r\nLeopards are the smallest of the large cats (to include lions, tigers, and jaguars) and are the most widespread, with subspecies found in Africa and Asia. They have a body structure similar to jaguars and are covered with flower-shaped spots on their backs called rosettes, with no dot in the center; the jaguar has a dot inside each of its rosettes. This profusion of spots helps leopards hide from their prey, breaking up their body outline in forests or grasslands. Leopards living in dry grasslands are a lighter color than those found in rain forests. \r\n\r\nIn the thick, dark rain forests of Southeast Asia, leopards that are nearly black can sometimes be found; these cats may look solid black at first glance, but their spotted pattern is visible in certain light.

('Macaw', 'http://zoo.sandiegozoo.org/sites/default/files/animal_hero/T05-0344-121.jpg\r\n\r\nMacaws are the giants of the parrot family. They are famous for their bright colors. Their red, yellow, green, and/or blue feathers seem bold and eye-catching to us but actually blend in well with the green leaves, red and yellow fruits, and bluish shadows of their rain forest home.\r\n\r\nA large, powerful beak allows the macaw to crush nuts and seeds. Its tongue is dry, slightly scaly, and has a bone inside it, all of which makes it an excellent tool for breaking open and eating food. Macaws have strong, flexible toes that are used like hands to grasp nuts or a perch.\r\n\r\nYou’ll find macaws perched just outside the Rio—The 4-D Adventure venue in the Children’s Zoo. And just before the Zoo opens each day, you can see a small flock of macaws fly across the Zoo’s front plaza. You may hear them before you see them!'),
('Madagascar Hissing Cockroach', 'http://www.sfzoo.org/images/gallery/hissingcockroach/img_hissingcockroach_ke_large.jpg\r\n\r\nThese cockroaches are shiny brown and oval-shaped, with no wings and a single pair of antennae. Males sport large horns, which give them an unusual and impressive appearance.\r\n\r\nHabitat/Diet\r\nThey are from the island of Madagascar off the African coast, where they can be found in rotting logs, leaf litter, and other detritus.\r\n\r\nAt night, they become more active and scavenge for meals, feeding primarily on fruit or plant materials. At the Zoo they are fed apples and other fruit.\r\n\r\nSocial Behavior\r\nThe Madagascar cockroach has become characterized by its hissing sound, large size, and appearance. In this insect, sound is produced by forcibly expelling air through a pair of modified abdominal spiracles. Spiracles are breathing pores which are part of the respiratory system of insects. Because the spiracles are involved in respiration, this method of sound production is more typical of the respiratory sound made by the vertebrates.'),

('Magellanic Penguins', 'http://www.sfzoo.org/images/gallery/penguin/img_penguin_mw_large.jpg\r\n\r\nThe San Francisco Zoo maintains the largest and most successful breeding colony of Magellanic penguins in captivity, having fledged approximately 205 chicks since 1985. The zoo also participates in a nationally-coordinated Population Management Plan sponsored by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.\r\n\r\nThe penguins live on Penguin Island, located between the Lion House and Pachyderm Building.\r\n\r\nFascinating Facts\r\nPenguin fossils date back to the Eocene period, 50 million years ago, and penguin ancestors were larger than the present day emperor penguin, which measures almost 4 feet. Aside from differences in size, penguins haven’t changed much in 50 million years.\r\nThe Magellanic penguin’s common name comes from the Straits of Magellan, a series of waterways at the southern tip of South America, where this species of penguin can be found.\r\nThe Magellanic penguin is one of 17 penguin species, all of which live in the southern hemisphere. Not all penguins live in the cold places, though; the climate in this species’ range is not that different from our climate here in northern California!\r\nAs they swim, they often pop out of the water to gulp air and then plunge back into the waves; this is called “porpoising”.\r\nPenguins possess a salt excreting gland, which allows them to drink sea water and shed the salt.\r\nPhysical Characteristics\r\nPenguins are highly specialized flightless sea birds. Their feathering is very dense, with more than 70 feathers per square inch, each coated with oil for waterproofing and warmth. Due to their excellent insulation, penguins are actually in greater danger of overheating than freezing.\r\n\r\nThese penguins can be identified by a characteristic white stripe that curves from their eyes around side of the head and meets under the chin. Adult penguins also have a dark black band across their chest. Young penguins first exchange their silvery down for an immature set of soft gray feathers without the distinctive striping of the adult. They molt into their adult coloration in their second year.\r\n\r\nPenguins, along with many other species, possess a unique type of camouflage called counter-shading. Their white belly blends in with the bright light above and their dark back blends in with the ocean below, making the birds hard for seals to spot.\r\n\r\nThe bodies of penguins are torpedo shaped and streamlined for moving through the water at speeds up to 15 miles per hour. Their small, flat wings work like paddles, driven by powerful flight muscles to propel the bird through the water.\r\n\r\nLifespan in the wild is 25 years, and up to 30 years in captivity.'),

Their furry head crests, manes, and beards are quite impressive, but what will really get your attention is their bright coloration. They have thick purple and blue ridges along the nose, their nose and lips are red, and their beard is golden.\r\n\r\nBut that’s not all—those bright colors show up again on the mandrills’ rear end! Why? Probably for displays, but also so they can follow each other in thick forests.\r\n\r\nSometimes mandrills shake their head and \"grin\" widely to show their enormous canine teeth, which can be over 2 inches (5 centimeters) long. This may appear scary to us, but it’s usually a friendly gesture within the mandrill community.\r\n\r\nIf a mandrill is upset, it may beat the ground energetically.

Though it resembles a red fox on stilts and has “wolf” in its name, this leggy canid is in a genus all its own: Chrysocyon.\r\n\r\nLook carefully, and you’ll see a dramatic, dark-colored mane down its back that flares up when the animal feels threatened. Unlike other canids, maned wolves lead a solitary life; although a pair may share a large home range of up to 17 square miles (44 square kilometers), each member hunts independently.\r\n\r\nAlthough classified as a carnivore, maned wolves are really omnivores, and during the rainy season, they eat mainly lobeira, a tomato-like fruit from a low, spiny bush—in fact, the fruit is also called the wolf apple for this reason!\r\n\r\nEach day, keepers give a talk and training demonstration with the maned wolves in their exhibit.'),

The winters in this viper’s habitat have many days of freezing temperatures. As colder days approach, Mang Mountain pit vipers crawl into caves and under rock ledges. Scientists have found that the snakes that go the deepest have the best chance of surviving until spring. Although their bite can deliver a deadly dose of venom, these snakes are shy most of the time. But a female guards her nest of eggs carefully and bites any creature that tries to steal them!

('Mexican Gray Wolf', 'http://www.sfzoo.org/images/gallery/_mammals/mexican%20gray%20wolf%20USFWS.jpg\r\n\r\nMexican gray wolves are the smallest gray wolf subspecies and are approximately half of the size of the North American gray wolf. They are between 26 – 32 inches at the shoulder, 4 ½ – 5 ½ feet in length from nose to tip of tail and weigh between 60 – 80 pounds. Males are slightly larger than females. Despite the name “gray” wolf, their coats are a mix of gray, rust, brown, black and cream. They tend to have darker colored backs and lighter colored bellies. They can live up to 15 years in captivity.\r\n\r\nHabitat/Diet\r\nMexican gray wolves are found in mountain woodlands, grasslands and scrublands. They once ranged from the southwestern U.S. to central Mexico. Their current range is restricted to Apache National Forest in southeastern Arizona.\r\n\r\nThey eat mainly elk, white-tailed deer, and mule deer, as well as javelinas, rabbits, ground squirrels, and mice. They hunt cooperatively so that they can take out prey much larger than themselves. They will also occasionally scavenge.\r\n\r\nSocial Behavior\r\nMexican gray wolves are social animals and live in packs, usually with an alpha breeding pair and their offspring. Mating season is between mid-February to mid-March and after a 63-day gestation period, a litter of 4 – 7 pups is born blind and helpless. The subordinates in the pack will help to raise the pups, who will become mature at 10 months of age. Wolves communicate through scent-marking, body language and vocalizations, including howling.\r\n\r\nStatus In The Wild\r\nBy the 1970\'s, Mexican gray wolves were wiped out in the United States. In 1998, eleven Mexican gray wolves were released into the wild by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. There are currently approximately 100 Mexican gray wolves in the wild today. The biggest threat to these animals is human intolerance. They are the most endangered wolf subspecies in the world.'),
('Mexican Wolf', 'http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/assets/img/species/mammals/MexicanGrayWolf_RobinSilver.jpg\r\n\r\nThe Mexican wolf (Canis lupus baileyi), also known as the lobo, is a subspecies of gray wolf once native to southeastern Arizona, southern New Mexico, western Texas and northern Mexico. It is the smallest of North America\'s gray wolves,[2] and is similar to C. l. nubilus, though it is distinguished by its smaller, narrower skull and its darker pelt, which is yellowish-gray and heavily clouded with black over the back and tail.[3] Its ancestors were likely the first gray wolves to enter North America after the extinction of the Beringian wolf, as indicated by its southern range and basal physical and genetic characteristics.[4]\r\nThough once held in high regard in Pre-Columbian Mexico,[5] it is the most endangered gray wolf in North America, having been extirpated in the wild during the mid-1900s through a combination of hunting, trapping, poisoning and digging pups from dens. After being listed under the Endangered Species Act in 1976, the United States and Mexico collaborated to capture all lobos remaining in the wild. This extreme measure prevented the lobos\' extinction. Five wild Mexican wolves (four males and one pregnant female) were captured alive in Mexico from 1977 to 1980 and used to start a captive breeding program. From this program, captive-bred Mexican wolves were released into recovery areas in Arizona and New Mexico beginning in 1998 in order to assist the animals\' recolonization of their former historical range.'),

In most of the US, it is called a mountain lion, cougar, or puma. In Florida, it is usually called a panther. No matter what the name, the mountain lion is a powerful and important predator. Mountain lions are the stealthiest of cats, hunting prey two to three times their own size. Some mountain lions eat porcupines, quills and all, apparently without any harm. Our mountain lions came to the Zoo after they were found orphaned in the wild at an age where they were much too young to care for themselves. Now they give our guests a chance to experience mountain lions, which frequently roam the hills just east and north of San Diego. We hope you will gain an appreciation of this magnificent cat that lives in San Diego’s own backyard.'),
('Naked Mole-rat', 'http://zoo.sandiegozoo.org/sites/default/files/animal_hero/T04-1332-052.jpg\r\n\r\nThe forbidding environment of East Africa’s deserts is home to one of the most bizarre rodents: the naked mole-rat. These beauties wouldn’t win any pageants, but they are fascinating animals. Yes, these odd little creatures with pink, wrinkly skin dig and live in underground burrows the way moles do. Yes, they have skinny, rat-like tails. Yet naked mole-rats are more closely related to porcupines and guinea pigs than they are to moles or rats and are the only species of mole-rat that has practically no hair!\r\n\r\nWhy are they \"naked\"? As underground dwellers, they don\'t need hair for sun protection. It\'s hard to see, but naked mole-rats do have about 100 fine hairs on their body that act like whiskers to help feel what\'s around them. Hairs between their toes help sweep soil behind them while tunneling.\r\n\r\nWatch these ever-busy animals scurry through their Plexiglass tunnels in the Children’s Zoo.'),
('Ocelot', 'http://www.beardsleyzoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Ocelot-Main.jpg\r\n\r\nAn ocelot is a small cat from the New World. It ranges from the very southern region of Texas all the way to northern Argentina in South America. The ocelot has one of the most beautiful coats of any animal in the world. Its fur is golden over most of its body, with white or cream on the belly; splashed over the background color are all sorts of patterns! \r\n\r\nMostly, the ocelot has black or dark brown spots arranged in a doughnut shape with dark tan in the middle. Sometimes these spots link together and form chains or stripes running along the cat’s sides and back. The ocelot has two stripes on its cheeks and a stripe running from the top of the eye over the head. The eyes also have white fur around them. The tail often has rings around the end and bands closer to the body. Wherever these patterns are missing, the ocelot usually has many small dots and blotches taking up the rest of the space.\r\n\r\nLike all small cats, ocelots have very good vision and hearing. Their eyes have a special layer that collects light, so ocelots can see much better in the dark than we can. In fact, it is as easy for an ocelot to walk around at night as it is for you to walk around during the day! Their sense of smell is a lot better than ours is but not as keen as a dog’s. Long whiskers help ocelots feel their way around, too. Although they are predators, ocelots are often harassed by groups of potential prey animals such as monkeys or birds.'),
('Okapi', 'https://www.macmillandictionary.com/external/slideshow/full/Okapi_full.jpg\r\n\r\nThe okapi (pronounced oh-COP-ee) is a beautiful and unusual animal. With its white-and-black striped hindquarters and front legs, it looks like it must be related to zebras! But take a look at an okapi’s head, and you’ll notice a resemblance to giraffes. The okapi is indeed the only living relative of the giraffe. Like a giraffe, the okapi has very large, upright ears, which catch even slight sounds, helping the animal avoid trouble. The okapi also has a long, dark, prehensile tongue, just like a giraffe’s, to help it strip the buds and young leaves from the understory brush of its rain forest home.\r\n\r\nOkapis are hard to find in the wild. Their natural habitat is the Ituri Forest, a dense rain forest in central Africa. Okapis are very wary, and their highly developed hearing alerts them to run when they hear humans in the distance. In fact, while natives of the Ituri Forest knew of okapis and would occasionally catch one in their pit traps, scientists did not know of the animal until 1900. The secretive nature of okapis and the difficulty most humans have of traveling in their habitat have made okapis hard to observe in the wild. Therefore, researchers can only estimate how many okapis live there. It is believed that there are currently about 25,000 okapis in the wild.'),

A pedestrian bridge goes between the exhibits so you can see otter/monkey action on either side. One of the exhibit’s pools is right up against the viewing glass, so you may see an otter gliding past you. Intelligent and curious, otters are usually busy hunting, investigating, or playing with something.

They have had a powerful hold on the human imagination across centuries and cultures, appearing as warnings of doom and as symbols of wisdom. Of course, we know that most are nocturnal, and their nighttime habits may make them seem scary or spooky to us. We think of them flying silently over churchyards, and their eyes seem to glow in the dark. But there’s nothing supernatural about the acute hearing and sight of owls. Far from fearing them, we should appreciate owls as competent predators that hunt mice and other rodents, helping to maintain a balance in nature.\r\n\r\nWhile most of us have no problem identifying an owl—just look for that round face, sharp, hooked bill, and large eyes—it’s not as easy to distinguish between different kinds of owls. Even scientists have trouble placing some species in the two family groups: barn owls and typical owls. You have to look carefully at their facial disc (for example, all barn owls have a heart-shaped facial disc, whereas typical owls have a round one), their feet, and whether or not they have ear tufts. Look for owls near your home, and see if you can identify local species.'),

There are exceptions, though: the Pesquet’s parrot is black with red trim, and you can probably guess what color the African gray parrot is! There are 279 parrot species in the world that include macaws, keas, lovebirds, parakeets, lorikeets, and kakapos. Although quite different from each other in many ways, these birds all have a curved beak, zygodactyl feet, and generally eat nuts, seeds, fruits, and insects. \r\n\r\nParrots have thick, strong beaks that are perfect for breaking open nuts and seeds with tough coverings.

They are small frogs, most are no bigger than a paper clip. They have a long, sticky tongue that darts out and captures their prey. Their feet contain four toes, each with a flattened tip and a suction cup pad used for gripping and clinging to vegetation in its habitat. They lack webbing between their toes and are poor swimmers; they are usually found near water but not in it.\r\n\r\nHabitat/Diet\r\nThese frogs are found in tropical rainforests in north and central South America. They are diurnal, terrestrial, and carnivorous, eating small invertebrates, particularly ants, which give them their poisonous properties in most cases. In the Zoo, they eat pinhead crickets and fruit flies.\r\n\r\nSocial Behavior\r\nThe males are territorial, calling to advertise to females and to defend their area. Calls are species dependent and can be anything from a buzz to trilling whistles. Females are slightly less territorial and do not call, but will wrestle with other females over their space.

Burrows have defined nurseries, sleeping quarters, and even toilets. They also feature listening posts near exits, so animals can safely keep tabs on the movements of predators outside. Prairie dogs spend a lot of time building and rebuilding these dwellings. Other animals benefit from their labors. Burrows may be shared by snakes, burrowing owls, and even rare black-footed ferrets, which hunt prairie dogs in their own dwellings.\r\n\r\nFamily groups (a male, a few females, and their young) inhabit burrows and cooperate to share food, chase off other prairie dogs, and groom one another. These group members even greet one another with a prairie dog kiss or nuzzle. Young pups are very playful and can often been seen romping near their burrows.\r\n\r\nPrairie Dog Species\r\n\r\nBlack-tailed prairie dogs, the best known of the five prairie dog species, live in larger communities called towns, which may contain many hundreds of animals.

Yet we should learn to appreciate the rattlesnake as one of the most efficient and specialized predators on Earth.\r\n\r\nThat famous rattle at the end of a rattlesnake’s tail is made of interlocking rings, or segments of keratin—the same material our fingernails are made of. When vibrated, the rattle creates a hissing sound that warns off potential predators. It is an extremely effective and highly evolved predator-avoidance system.\r\n\r\nAnother rattlesnake characteristic is the \"pit\" on each side of the head, which is a heat-sensitive organ for locating prey.\r\n\r\nThe Zoo is home to 13 rattlesnake species, representing rattlers found both near and far.

('Red Harvester Ant', 'http://www.sfzoo.org/images/gallery/harvesterant/img_harvesterant_mh_large.jpg\r\n\r\nWorkers of the red harvester ant colonies have long bodies, 1/4 to 1/2-inch long, and range in color from red to dark brown. They have square heads and no spines on their bodies. Winged males and female swarmers are larger than worker ants.\r\n\r\nHabitat/Diet\r\nRed harvester ants are common in the southwest United States. The main food source for red harvester ants usually consists of seeds, which they hoard in great numbers, hence their name.\r\n\r\nSocial Behavior\r\nThey have a powerful sting which they are not shy about using. Their sting is quite painful and best avoided. In the evening, a few Pogonomyrmex barbatus workers will usually seal the nest entrance with gravel and twigs to keep nighttime intruders out of the nest.\r\n\r\nWinged males and females swarm, pair and mate. Males soon die and females seek a suitable nesting site. After dropping her wings, the queen ant digs a burrow and produces a few eggs. Larvae hatch from eggs and developed through several stages (instars). Larvae are white and legless, shaped like a crookneck squash with a small distinct head. Pupation occurs within a cocoon. Worker ants produced by the queen ant begin caring for other developing ants, enlarge the nest and forage for food.\r\n\r\nStatus In The Wild\r\nRed harvester ants are common and not endangered.'),

Males have short, red-brown fur, fading to pale buff below and on the limbs. Females are smaller than males and are blue-grey with a brown tinge, pale grey below, although arid zone females are coloured more like males. It has two forelimbs with small claws, two muscular hind-limbs, which are used for jumping, and a strong tail which is often used to create a tripod when standing upright. The red kangaroo\'s legs work much like a rubber band, with the Achilles tendon stretching as the animal comes down, then releasing its energy to propel the animal up and forward, enabling the characteristic bouncing locomotion. The males can cover 8–9 m (26.2–29.5 ft) in one leap while reaching heights of 1.8–3 m (5.9–9.8 ft), though the average is 1.2–1.9 m (3.9–6.2 ft)[4][5]'),
('Red Panda', 'http://zoo.sandiegozoo.org/sites/default/files/animal_hero/T05-0657-013.jpg\r\n\r\nAlthough red pandas like to eat bamboo and live in China’s bamboo forests with giant pandas, don’t let their name fool you. Formerly known as lesser pandas, DNA studies show that red pandas represent a unique family that diverged from the rest of the carnivore order, so they are now placed in their own unique family: Ailuridae. The Chinese name for the red panda is hun-ho, meaning fire fox. The red panda’s reddish coat and white face mask offer camouflage among the red moss and white lichen that cover the trees of its bamboo forest home. San Diego Zoo Global supports the Red Panda Network, a nonprofit organization that identifies unprotected red panda habitat and trains “forest guardians” to conduct awareness-building workshops on red pandas at local villages and work with villagers to establish new protected areas. Forest guardians also continue baseline research and monitoring of red panda populations.'),
('Red River Hog', 'http://www.zoonewengland.org/media/466435/redriverhog_gallery1.jpg\r\n\r\nRed river hogs are the most colorful member of the pig family, getting their name from the red coat and tendency to often wallow in rivers and streams. Coloration and distinctive markings of this animal can vary quite a bit; those found in West Africa are predominantly red with a white stripe along their backs, while those found in the eastern and southern habitats can be red, brown or black, sometimes becoming darker with age. Many will also have a white facial mask. In male hogs, the elongated snout features two well-developed warts. These warts provide added protection from tusk damage during fights for dominance with other males. As in all wild pigs, the canine teeth extend to tusks. Red river hogs are quick on land, but will swim if they need to.\r\nSize\r\nRed river hogs are the smallest of the African pigs on average, growing to 40 to 50 inches (102 to 127 centimeters) in length and weighing 100 to 285 pounds (45 to 129 kilograms).\r\nNative Habitat\r\nRed river hogs have a wide, but somewhat patchy distribution, present primarily in rainforests and adjacent savanna. They can also be found in dry forests and cultivated areas not far from rainforests, preferring lots of brush to forage and hide in. A highly adaptable species, red river hogs have done well with increasing human encroachment, sometimes feeding on local crops, occasionally making them an agricultural pest.'),

Juveniles are brownish and change to bright green as the mature. Belly is light blue or cream colored, legs are blue and feet are red – orange. Eyes are bright red in adults. Toes have suction cups to help them adhere themselves to the undersides of leaves. They are excellent climbers and also can swim.\r\n\r\nHabitat/Diet\r\nRed-eyed tree frogs are found in lowland tropical rainforests with high humidity and warm daytime and nighttime temperatures, often near a river or water source. They are found in southern Mexico south throughout Central America. They feed predominately on crickets, moths, flies and grasshoppers, but will eat other insects and even small frogs.\r\n\r\nSocial Behavior\r\nRed-eyed tree frogs reproduce during the rainy season. Males will croak to attract females and perform a “quivering” display to establish territory and intimidate other suitors. Males will clasp on to the back of the female in what is known as “amplexus” and fertilize the eggs that she lays. Mating takes place on the underside of a leaf hanging above a water source so that when the eggs hatch, the tadpoles will drop into water.'),

It belongs to Lemuridae, one of five lemur families, and is the only member of the Lemur genus. Like all lemurs it is endemic to the island of Madagascar. Known locally in Malagasy as maky ([mak?] (About this sound listen), spelled maki in French) or hira, it inhabits gallery forests to spiny scrub in the southern regions of the island. It is omnivorous and the most terrestrial of extant lemurs. The animal is diurnal, being active exclusively in daylight hours.\r\nThe ring-tailed lemur is highly social, living in groups of up to 30 individuals. It is also female dominant, a trait common among lemurs. To keep warm and reaffirm social bonds, groups will huddle together. The ring-tailed lemur will also sunbathe, sitting upright facing its underside, with its thinner white fur towards the sun. Like other lemurs, this species relies strongly on its sense of smell and marks its territory with scent glands. The males perform a unique scent marking behavior called spur marking and will participate in stink fights by impregnating their tail with their scent and wafting it at opponents.\r\nAs one of the most vocal primates, the ring-tailed lemur uses numerous vocalizations including group cohesion and alarm calls. Experiments have shown that the ring-tailed lemur, despite the lack of a large brain (relative to simiiform primates), can organize sequences, understand basic arithmetic operations and preferentially select tools based on functional qualities.\r\nDespite reproducing readily in captivity and being the most populous lemur in zoos worldwide, numbering more than 2,000 individuals, the ring-tailed lemur is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List due to habitat destruction and hunting for bush meat and the exotic pet trade. As of early 2017, the population in the wild is believed to have crashed as low as 2,000 individuals due to habitat loss, poaching and hunting, making them far more critically endangered.[5]'),

They have streamlined bodies and four limbs that are modified into flippers. Though not as fast in the water as dolphins, seals are more flexible and agile. Otariids use their front limbs primarily to propel themselves through the water, while phocids and walruses use their hind limbs. Otariids and walruses have hind limbs that can be pulled under the body and used as legs on land. By comparison, terrestrial locomotion by phocids is more cumbersome. Otariids have visible external ears, while phocids and walruses lack these. Pinnipeds have well-developed senses—their eyesight and hearing are adapted for both air and water, and they have an advanced tactile system in their whiskers or vibrissae. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep warm in the cold water, and, other than the walrus, all species are covered in fur.');

Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name \"sheep\" applies to many species in the genus Ovis, in everyday usage it almost always refers to Ovis aries. Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a ewe (/ju?/), an intact male as a ram or occasionally a tup, a castrated male as a wether, and a younger sheep as a lamb.\r\nSheep are most likely descended from the wild mouflon of Europe and Asia. One of the earliest animals to be domesticated for agricultural purposes, sheep are raised for fleece, meat (lamb, hogget or mutton) and milk. A sheep\'s wool is the most widely used animal fiber, and is usually harvested by shearing. Ovine meat is called lamb when from younger animals and mutton when from older ones. Sheep continue to be important for wool and meat today, and are also occasionally raised for pelts, as dairy animals, or as model organisms for science.\r\nSheep husbandry is practised throughout the majority of the inhabited world, and has been fundamental to many civilizations. In the modern era, Australia, New Zealand, the southern and central South American nations, and the British Isles are most closely associated with sheep production.\r\nSheepraising has a large lexicon of unique terms which vary considerably by region and dialect. Use of the word sheep began in Middle English as a derivation of the Old English word sc?ap; it is both the singular and plural name for the animal. A group of sheep is called a flock, herd or mob.

Their arms are longer than their legs, spanning up to five feet in a large adult. They move between the trees by brachiating, using their long, hook-fingered hands. Efficient and graceful in the trees, they are awkward on the ground, and will sometimes walk with their hands held overhead for balance like tightrope walkers.\r\n\r\nTheir jet black coat is heavy, shaggy fur. The face is naked except for scattered and sparse stubble of moustache and beard.\r\n\r\nAll of the lesser apes have loud voices, but the siamang also has a large inflatable throat sac to further magnify its calls. The siamang “song”, usually performed at dawn and several times throughout the day, is a combination of deep, resonant hoots and higher-pitched shrieks. These calls act help to maintain territories and communicate with other siamang groups.\r\n\r\nLifespan is 20 – 25 years in the wild and up to 30 in captivity.\r\n\r\nHabitat/Diet\r\nSiamangs spend almost all of their time high in the rainforest canopies of Sumatra, mainland Malaysia and southern Thailand. They are often found in areas with a high concentration of figs, their favorite fruit.\r\n\r\nSiamangs are omnivores and feed primarily on fruits, buds, foliage and flowers but will also eat insects, spiders, small lizards and bird eggs. At the Zoo, the siamangs are fed a diet of apples, oranges, bananas, lettuce, bread and cooked sweet potatoes.\r\n\r\nSocial Behavior\r\nFamily groups consists of an adult pair and as many as four of their offspring. Within each family, food is generously shared and fighting rarely occurs. Siamangs are territorial and members of the same family will drive off intruders. Grooming is the most important social behavior to reinforce bonds between individuals.\r\n\r\nEvery two or three years they give birth to single young after a gestation period of 230 days. Siamangs are monogamous and display an unusually high level of parental care. At about one year of age, the adult male takes over most of the daily care of the young. But the prolonged maternal care of infants by the mother may last as long as 20 months. Juvenile siamangs will leave the group to find a mate and establish a family at around six years of age.\r\n\r\nStatus In The Wild\r\nSiamangs are listed as endangered by the IUCN and on appendix I of CITES.

Most closely related to horses and rhinos, tapirs have a nose and upper lip combined into a flexible snout like an elephant’s trunk, which they use to reach and pull plant material into the mouth. You can view our tapirs from three different spots along the trail. Their exhibit is shaded by a variety of fan palms and ferns, and a large pool provides a great place for the tapirs to take a dip. The animals don’t swim; instead, they hold their breath, sink to the bottom, and walk! Do we have more tapirs? Yes! You’ll find the smaller Baird’s tapirs living with capybaras in the Zoo’s Elephant Odyssey.'),
('Tarantula', 'http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/wm/live/1280_720/images/live/p0/2v/n0/p02vn0wr.jpg\r\n\r\nTarantulas give people the creeps because they have large, hairy bodies and legs. While these large spiders can take a painful bite out of a human, a tarantula\'s venom is weaker than from a typical bee sting. \r\n\r\nTarantulas move slowly on their eight hairy legs, but they are accomplished nocturnal predators. Insects are their main prey, but they also target bigger game, including frogs, toads, and mice. Tarantulas are burrowers and typically live in the ground. \r\n\r\nThere are hundreds of tarantula species found in most of the world\'s tropical, subtropical, and desert regions. They vary in color and behavior according to their specific environments. A tarantula doesn\'t use a web to trap its prey, though it may spin a trip wire to signal an alert when something approaches its burrow. These spiders grab with their legs, inject paralyzing venom, and then bite their prey with their fangs. They also secrete digestive enzymes to liquefy their victims\' bodies so that they can suck them up through their strawlike mouth openings. Yum!'),
('Tasmanian Devil', 'http://zoo.sandiegozoo.org/sites/default/files/animal_hero/T12_0614_039.jpg\r\n\r\nThe Tasmanian devil is not just a cartoon! It is a most unusual mammal, found only on the island state of Tasmania, a part of Australia. Why the “fiery” name and reputation? When a group of devils feeds together at a carcass, harsh screeching and spine-chilling screams can be heard. Devils are also black in color and are said to have fierce tempers!\r\n\r\nThe San Diego Zoo is currently one of only two zoos in the US with Tasmanian devils. Wild devils face extinction due to devil facial tumor disease (DFTD), a rare, contagious cancer found only in devils. Our devils are free of this disease.\r\n\r\nWe are a proud partner of the Save the Tasmanian Devil Program based in Tasmania. The program collaborates with research institutes and zoos around the world to save this interesting marsupial.\r\n\r\nDid you know? Devil babies, called joeys, grow up in their mother’s pouch.'),
('Thick-billed Parrot', 'http://zoonooz.sandiegozoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/T00-575-03.jpg\r\n\r\nThe thick-billed parrot (Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha) is a medium-sized green and red parrot found in Mexico, that formerly ranged into the southwestern United States. Its position in parrot phylogeny is the subject of ongoing discussion; it is sometimes referred to as thick-billed macaw or thick-billed conure. In Mexico, it is locally called guacamaya (\"macaw\") or cotorra serrana (\"mountain parrot\"). Classified internationally as Endangered through IUCN,[1] the thick-billed parrot\'s decline has been central to multiple controversies over wildlife management.\r\n\r\nThe thick-billed parrot is a medium-sized, bright green parrot with a large black bill and red forecrown, shoulder and thighs. Adult eyes are amber, while juveniles have brown eyes. The rest of the bird is bright green. Thick-billed parrots show red shoulders and leading edge on the underwing, followed by a blackish green stripe, then a yellow stripe, followed by the remaining underwing showing dark green. The tail is black.[5] It is 38 cm (15 in) long and weighs 315-370 g. Thick-billed parrots have lived up to 33 years in captivity.[6] It is similar in appearance to the military macaw Ara militaris, which is larger with a proportionally longer tail and blue flight feathers and rump, and the lilac-crowned amazon Amazona finschi[5] (note that these are not the phylogenetically closest relatives - see Taxonomy).\r\nThe voice of the thick-billed parrot resembles a high-pitched macaw and includes a variety of harsh, rolling calls described as similar to human laughter. Although readily becoming hand-tame, the species is nervous and difficult to breed in captivity, with very low reproduction rates. Captive birds are fair voice mimics and can learn a few phrases and words. However, their piercing calls and comparatively duller coloration has prevented them from becoming popular pet trade birds, and currently there is little demand for them as illegally wild-caught or captive bred birds.\r\nLike other parrots, they manipulate their food by holding it with one foot. Highly social, they may feed each other food stored in their crop (a pouch in the throat), and spend their free time preening each other. Groups of over 1,000 birds in one place are known from historical records.'),
('Tiger', 'http://zoo.sandiegozoo.org/sites/default/files/animal_hero/T09_0200_147.jpg\r\n\r\nMesmerizing and gorgeous, but also endangered, our Malayan tigers are always a pleasure to watch. Their exhibit was designed to closely resemble a natural jungle habitat and was built on a steep slope that gives the big cats plenty of exercise. You can safely view these powerful hunters from three vantage points along Tiger Trail.\r\n\r\nAlthough not as social as lions, tigers vocalize more frequently and have a wide range of vocalizations, including roars, grunts, hisses, and chuffles. A tiger’s confrontational roar is made when challenging other tigers at long range, defending a meal, or attracting a breeding partner. The roar contains energy in the infrasonic range, below human hearing, helping the sound carry over long distances. A chuffle is a friendly greeting, usually used between a mother and her cubs.\r\n\r\nUse push buttons next to the tiger exhibit to listen to the different sounds a tiger makes!'),
('Tiger Salamander', 'http://www.sfzoo.org/images/gallery/tigersalamander/tigersalamander_1.jpg\r\n\r\nTiger salamanders are large, stocky black with yellowish blotches or stripes, which are unique for each individual. Their color darkens with age. They have a short, rounded head, blunt snout, small protuberant eyes and thick necks, with sturdy legs, and long tails.\r\n\r\nTiger salamanders have a poisonous tail gland, which produces a toxic milky secretion for self-defense. They will curl up head and tail to display this gland as a warning. They also have specialized foot pads for burrowing.\r\n\r\nLarvae are yellowish gray with broad caudal fins that extend well onto the back, broad flat heads, and bushy gills. They also have a whitish belly.\r\n\r\nHabitat/Diet\r\nThe tiger salamander is found in a wide range across North America, southern Canada, and eastern Mexico. They live in wetlands and grasslands with long-lasting vernal pools, which are free from predatory fish. In the wild, they eat earthworms and other invertebrates. At the Zoo, they are fed crickets and earthworms.\r\n\r\nSocial Behavior\r\nAdults live almost exclusively on land, entering the water only to breed. They spend most of their time underground, often in mammal burrows. They live in deep burrows, up to two feet. They are highly voracious predators, who emerge from their burrows at night. In the wild they can live 5-6 years, but in captivity they can reach 12-15 years.'),
('Turkey', 'http://www.sfzoo.org/images/gallery/turkey/img_turkey_gn_large.jpg\r\n\r\nTurkeys are large, stocky birds weighing almost 25 pounds. They have long legs and short rounded wings. Male wild turkeys are quite striking in appearance, with an overall blackish-brown body and bronze-green iridescent sheen. Flight feathers are barred with white and the brightly colored head is featherless. Depending on the season, males head and neck are either red, blue or grey. The wattle hanging under the beak is red. Their head is covered by growths called caruncles and the long fleshy object over the beak is called a snood. Males, or toms, also have a spurs on their feet and can grow long bristles on their chest. Females, in comparison, have a duller plumage and lack brightly colored heads and necks.\r\n\r\nJuveniles are light brown with mottled dark brown wings. Domesticated turkeys typically have white and black plumage with the usual coloration on the head and neck.\r\n\r\nLifespan is about 1.5-2 years in the wild, although one turkey lived to 13 years old.\r\n\r\nHabitat/Diet\r\nIt is the mostly found throughout the United States and parts of northern Mexico and southern Canada. They are widespread in forests, pastures, grasslands, and wetlands. It is most commonly found in relatively open areas which provide nearby woods for nesting.\r\n\r\nTurkeys are omnivorous; foraging for acorns, nuts, various seeds, berries and insects. They also occasionally consume amphibians and small reptiles such as lizards and snakes.\r\n\r\nSocial Behavior\r\nDuring the winter these birds gather in groups of up to 200, especially where food is plentiful. Throughout the rest of the year they are more commonly found in groups that consist of one male and several females or, after breeding season, small flocks of females with their chicks.\r\n\r\nMale turkeys display for females by puffing out their feathers, spreading out their tails and dragging their wings. This behavior is most commonly referred to as strutting. They also use gobbling, drumming/booming and spitting as signs of social dominance, and to attract females.\r\n\r\nBreeding season usually occurs between April-May. Nests are made by scratching a shallow depression in the ground in tall grass or in tangles of brush. Several females may lay eggs in a single nest but hens typically lay 4-17 eggs on their own. Eggs are incubated for 25-31 days and the precocial chicks fledge after just 24 hours. Young can fly in about 10 days and begin to roost in trees with adults after 2 weeks. Male chicks are independent by fall, while female chicks remain until around 10 months of age.\r\n\r\nTurkeys are known to produce up to 15 distinct vocalizations. The iconic “gobble” of a male can be heard from a mile away.'),
('Turtle', 'http://zoo.sandiegozoo.org/sites/default/files/animal_hero/T05-0747-018%202.jpg\r\n\r\nWhat’s not to like about turtles? In the Zoo’s Discovery Outpost, a large pond habitat features narrow-headed softshell turtles, painted terrapins, stripe-necked turtles, Fly River turtles, and a Malaysian giant turtle named The General, who was rescued from a shipment destined for an Asian food market. The turtles in this large pond can be seen swimming around the exhibit, with great views available through the underwater viewing window. When not swimming, they often practice their “submarine\" imitation, rising slowly to the surface to take a breath before sinking again in exactly the same spot, as bubbles come up around them. In Lost Forest, you’ll find more turtles and terrapins. (Terrapins spend time both on land and in water, but always live near water, along rivers, ponds, and lakes.) And at the Zoo’s Reptile House, you\'ll find huge alligator snapping turtles. They are all great fun to watch!'),
('Two-Toed Sloth', 'http://www.sfzoo.org/images/gallery/sloth/sloth-1.jpg\r\n\r\nSouthern two-toed sloths are between 21 – 29 inches in length and weigh between 8 – 17 pounds. They have four long limbs with two toes on their front feet and three toes on their back feet. Their three to four inch curved claws help them hold onto branches as they move through the forest canopy. Their head is short and flat with a snub nose, small ears and large eyes. These sloths have long coarse fur with a dense and smooth undercoat that provides good insulation. The algae growing on their fur gives them a greenish hue, allowing them to blend in with their surroundings.\r\n\r\nTheir teeth grow continuously and are worn down by their leafy diet. They have a 10 inch long tongue that is covered with sharp, backward facing spines to help them to collect food. A slow metabolic rate allows them to survive on a diet that provides little nourishment; while their four-chambered stomach assists with breaking down plant matter.\r\n\r\nLifespan is up to 25 years in the wild and up to 30 years in captivity.'),
('Waldrapp Ibis', 'http://www.sfzoo.org/images/gallery/_birds/White%20Ibis%203%20MH.jpg\r\n\r\nThe white ibis is covered in white plumage with scarlet legs, facial skin, and bill. Their black wing tips are usually only visible in flight. As juveniles, they are dark and mostly grey, molting into white adult plumage by early in their second year. During the breeding season, their legs, face, and beaks turn from pale orange to bright pink.\r\n\r\nHabitat/Diet\r\nWhite ibis are found in the southeastern United States south to northern Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela. They live in shallow coastal marshes, wetlands, and mangrove swamps with salt, brackish, or fresh water. They are diurnal and carnivorous, feeding on small aquatic prey such as insects, crayfish, frogs, and small fishes.\r\n\r\nSocial Behavior\r\nWhite ibis have a harsh and nasal “hunk-hunk-hunk-hunk” alarm call uttered by the male, while females simply squeal. They often utter a soft grunting “croo-croo-croo” while foraging. White ibis are highly gregarious, living in flocks and nesting in huge colonies near water that can number up to the tens of thousands. They will defend their small nesting territory and show some aggression while mating, jabbing at rivals, or catching an opponent’s wing or head in their bill.\r\n\r\nStatus In The Wild\r\nWhite ibis are listed as Least Concern by IUCN. White ibis populations are large and do not appear to be decreasing, but they are being monitored to ensure the major threats of habitat loss and destruction of colony sites do not have too large an impact. Nesting adults are particularly sensitive to disturbance, and eggs and chicks left alone due to human intrusion are susceptible to predation. Since this species nests in large groups, nest disturbance could have devastating effects on a colony.'),
('Whip Scorpion', 'https://media1.britannica.com/eb-media/57/164057-004-8F506C30.jpg\r\n\r\nThelyphonida is an arachnid order comprising invertebrates commonly known as whip scorpions or vinegaroons (also spelled vinegarroons and vinegarones). They are often called uropygids in the scientific community based on an alternative name for the order, Uropygi (which may then also include the order Schizomida). The name \"whip scorpion\" refers to their resemblance to true scorpions and possession of a whiplike tail. \"Vinegaroon\" is based on their ability when attacked to discharge an offensive liquid which contains acetic acid, producing a vinegar-like smell.'),
('White-Eyed Assassin Bug', 'http://www.sfzoo.org/images/gallery/assassinbug/img_assassinbug_bf_large.jpg\r\n\r\nThey have piercing mouthparts that are shaped into a beak and deliver a paralyzing bite to invertebrate prey (caterpillars are especially favored). The two large white spots on their wing cases give them their common name.\r\n\r\nHabitat/Diet\r\nWhite-eyed Assassin Bugs are found in the drier regions of southern Africa. They prey on soft-bodied insects and occasionally vertebrate blood.\r\n\r\nSocial Behavior\r\nWhite-eyed Assasssin Bugs hide in groups under peeling bark, logs, and rocks. They emerge at night to feed.\r\n\r\nStatus In The Wild\r\nThey are not endangered.'),
('White-handed Gibbon', 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MSmg48orZqI/maxresdefault.jpg\r\n\r\nThe lar gibbon (Hylobates lar), also known as the white-handed gibbon, is an endangered primate in the gibbon family, Hylobatidae. It is one of the better-known gibbons and is often seen in zoos.\r\n\r\nThe fur coloring of the lar gibbon varies from black and dark-brown to light-brown, sandy colors. The hands and feet are white-colored, likewise a ring of white hair surrounds the black face. Both males and females can be all color variants, and the sexes also hardly differ in size. Gibbons are true brachiators, propelling themselves through the forest by swinging under the branches using their arms. Reflecting this mode of locomotion, the white-handed gibbon has curved fingers, elongated hands, extremely long arms and relatively short legs, giving it an intermembral index of 129.7, one of the highest of the primates.[4] As with all apes, the number of caudal vertebrae has been reduced drastically, resulting in the loss of a functional tail. Gibbons have tough, bony padding on their buttocks, known as the ischial callosities, or sitting pads.'),
('Wolverine', 'http://www.sfzoo.org/images/gallery/wolverine/img_wolverine2_MH_large.jpg\r\n\r\nWith thick fur and large paws, wolverines are well adapted for living in a cold environment. They are about 25 – 34 inches long and can weigh between 24 – 40 pounds; males can be significantly larger than females. They are stocky and muscular with a broad, rounded head, small eyes, and short rounded ears. Their short legs and wide five-toed paws help them move through deep snow. Wolverines have a keen sense of smell but poor eyesight. They have very powerful jaws capable of crushing bones and tearing frozen meat.\r\n\r\nTheir fur is brownish-black with a pale stripe down the sides and across the rump and sometimes white markings on the chest. Each animal has a unique coloration so researchers are able to identify individuals by their coat pattern.\r\n\r\nLifespan is 4 – 6 years in the wild and up to 13 years in captivity.\r\n\r\nHabitat/Diet\r\nThey are found in boreal forests, taiga, alpine, and tundra habitats of northern Europe and Asia, Canada, and Alaska. Wolverines are found in areas with cold climates and prefer areas with low human populations.\r\n\r\nWolverines are omnivores and have a varied diet that changes based on availability. For instance, in the summer they might eat berries, eggs, and plant matter, but throughout the year their diet primarily includes meat. They actively hunt animals such as squirrels, rabbits, birds, and injured or weakened deer and moose. Wolverines are such tenacious predators they can take down prey many times their own size, especially if the prey gets stuck in the snow. They are extremely opportunistic eaters regularly eating carrion and have even been seen scavenging whales, seals, and walrus.\r\n\r\nSocial Behavior\r\nWolverines are solitary and very territorial, marking their range using their scent glands. Males have large territories and will fiercely defend that area against other males. They will also mark food, decreasing the likelihood that other animals will steal it. Female’s territories do not overlap but a male might share a territory with several females. Wolverines do not hibernate; instead they spend the winter traveling several miles a day in search of food.\r\n\r\nFemales build a den in caves or under snow and will give birth to an average of three cubs.\r\n\r\nBreeding occurs in the summer but wolverines delay implantation so that cubs are born in late winter or early spring. Young are born small and helpless after a gestation period of only 30 – 50 days. They will stay with their mother for up to two years before leaving to establish their own territory.\r\n\r\nAs adults, wolverines have few natural predators but wolves, bears, and eagles can be threats to young wolverines.\r\n\r\nStatus In The Wild\r\nWolverines are listed as least concern by the IUCN. They require large territories which often brings them into conflict with human development. Hunting and trapping have reduced their numbers so that they occur in only a small portion of their former range. Wolverines\' thick fur was once prized to make clothing but this is not a significant threat today as they are protected throughout much of their range.'),

If threatened, a wombat dives headfirst into a tunnel, blocking the entrance with its sturdy backside.\r\n\r\nDid you know? Wombat incisor teeth never stop growing but are gnawed down from the tough vegetation the animal eats. It can take a wombat up to 14 days to completely digest one meal.'),
('Yellow-footed Rock Wallaby', 'https://www.monartozoo.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/animals/YellowFootedRockWallaby4Slider.jpg\r\n\r\nThe yellow-footed rock wallaby is a marsupial—a pouched mammal—belonging to the same family as the kangaroo. This rock wallaby lives in mountain habitats in isolated portions of Australia. \r\n\r\nThe wallaby moves easily around mountaintops, jumping as far as 13 feet (four meters) from rock to rock and even scaling cliffs and climbing trees. In the hot Australian summers, the wallaby is active only at night, while in the winter it can sometimes be seen sunbathing on the rocks. \r\n\r\nThe yellow-footed rock wallaby has some of the brightest and most distinctive fur of all the wallabies and kangaroos. The wallaby’s fur varies in color and is usually a mixture of brown, gray, white, and yellow or orange. These colors are thought to provide camouflage among the surrounding rocks. \r\n\r\nThe yellow-footed rock wallaby eats mainly grasses, but in the dry season also feeds on whatever leaves fall from the trees and shrubs that grow in its rocky habitat. The wallaby can drink an impressive amount of water during the hot summers. They are able to drink more than 10 percent of their body weight within a few minutes. '),

('Bog Garden', 'San Diego Zoo', 'http://zoo.sandiegozoo.org/sites/default/files/animal_hero/BogGardenT11-0571-018.jpg\r\n\r\nIn the nearly sterile, acidic, low-oxygen environments called bogs, you\'ll encounter one of nature\'s most inspired adaptations: carnivorous plants. In these difficult environments, plants have adapted to lure, trap, and digest insects and other small animals in order to survive. Like other plants, they still use the sun\'s energy and the traditional photosynthesis process, and they produce flowers in the spring to ensure pollination by the first insect visitors.\r\n\r\nAny insects that come along after that are not so lucky. Carnivorous plants entice their victims with bright colors and scents like sweet nectar or the stench of animal carcasses, but then they use narcotic secretions and even \"teeth\" to draw the insects into a trap and snap shut on them. The insects are ensnared in a sticky web of hairs, sucked into a bladder of no return, or sent down a slippery tube to dissolve in a soup of digestive enzymes.\r\n\r\nWhy are animal-eating plants mostly restricted to bogs? Apparently their special adaptation comes at a high cost: in better soil, other plants take over. There are hundreds of carnivorous plant species, but these botanical wonders are threatened by the urban development that replaces wetland habitats, and by collectors who take the plants without considering the damage they\'re doing.\r\n\r\nThe Zoo\'s Bog Garden, located in the Lost Forest, features Venus fly traps, pitcher plants, sun dews, and bladder worts. To provide these plants with their natural environment, our gardener has to keep this area swampy. The Bog Garden\'s soil is a mix of washed sand and sphagnum peat. It is kept moist with deionized water, filtered to get rid of the salts and minerals found in San Diego\'s water supply, and completely saturated every four days to mimic the rainy conditions the plants are used to.

Most bromeliads collect a pool of water in their centers and flower above the cup. Then when insects and small animals stop by for a dip, or to eat the microorganisms and larvae growing in the cup, the blossoms also dip and pollination occurs.

Part of this garden\'s beauty is that visitors get to see butterflies in all stages of the life cycle, close enough for everyone to observe.\r\n\r\nPassion vine Passiflora sp. adorns the trellises that surround the garden and is a favorite food of Gulf fritillary caterpillars. The aptly named butterfly weed Asclepias tuberose, a North American native, seems to be the plant of choice for monarch caterpillars. It can be grown easily from seed and will naturalize in our Southern California gardens. Pincushion flower Scabiosa columbaria has a long blooming season. It will flower from spring through summer, if you cut off the dead flowers regularly. Yarrow Achillea sp. is one of the least demanding plants to grow in a garden. It makes a good and inexpensive plant to fill any bare edge you may have, and adult butterflies are attracted to the broad flower spikes. Salvia Salvia microphyllaxgreggii attracts both butterflies and hummingbirds; statice, or sea lavender, Limonium perezii, is a natural \"landing pad\" for butterflies. They like to sun themselves on the purple butterfly landing strip formed by the flowers.\r\n\r\nWe hope this beautiful garden with its fanciful flying visitors will inspire our two-legged visitors to plant butterfly gardens of their own.

As you follow the pathway down, you\'ll be surrounded by lush green ferns of all sizes under a lacy canopy of purple-flowering jacarandas. Intertwined giant Burmese honeysuckle and Easter lily vines, Formosa palms, and other magnificent flora grow near the path and on the banks of the canyon\'s winding stream. Near the end of the pathway, you\'ll see one of the largest red ball trees Dombeya cacuminum in the continental United States.\r\n\r\nAs you might guess from its name, Fern Canyon is a fern fancier\'s paradise, with ferns ranging from small sword ferns to 40-foot-high (12-meter) tree ferns. Some of the first plants to evolve, ferns reproduce with spores rather than seeds (flowering plants came along much later in plant evolution). When you meander down Fern Canyon\'s lovely path, shaded by giant, primeval-looking tree ferns, you can imagine that you\'ve gone back to the era of dinosaurs and carboniferous swamps. Hardy and adaptable, fern species have propagated almost everywhere since those prehistoric times, even in the Arctic!\r\n\r\nDuring springtime and summer, Fern Canyon displays a sublime canopy of purple and yellow lace with red highlights, thanks to the blooming of its yellow Schizolobium parahybum and purple jacaranda trees Jacaranda mimosifolia, and the Australian flame trees Brachychiton acerifolius out front.

Our aviary plants are extremely important for encouraging natural avian behavior, whether the birds use them for marking territories, making nests, or as special perches for courtship displays. This is why the plants and trees in all our aviaries tend to have a more natural, wilder look.\r\n\r\nThe Zoo\'s horticultural treasures are very important for our gorillas\' health and contentment.

Since Magellanic penguins inhabit the Strait of Magellan and the coastal regions of Argentina, Chile and the Falkland Islands, they are right at home in San Francisco\'s temperate, marine climate.\r\n\r\nPenguin Island has one of the most successful captive breeding colonies in the world, with 205 penguin chicks fledged since the old reflecting pool was renovated to accommodate penguins in 1984.

The task of maintaining a varied plant collection while creating natural habitats for the animal residents can be challenging. For example, in the green iguana exhibit on Reptile Mesa, the evergreen shrub, Xylosma sp., was selected because it is not a particularly flavorful plant from an iguana\'s point of view, so the lizards would not consume it as fast as we planted it, which can often occur. Moreover, this plant is sturdy enough to allow these large-bodied lizards, which can weigh up to 8 or 10 pounds (3 to 5 kilograms), to bask on top of them.\r\n\r\nAmazingly enough, Galápagos tortoises enjoy cactus now and then, whether the spines have been scraped off or not! That\'s because the spines don\'t hurt their leathery mouths, and the pads make a delicious, juicy snack. Keepers often harvest pads from the prickly pears and other cactuses on Reptile Mesa to make tortoise treats. And many of our lizards get hibiscus leaves and flowers for browse. '),

Part of this garden\'s beauty is that visitors get to see butterflies in all stages of the life cycle, close enough for everyone to observe.\r\n\r\nPassion vine Passiflora sp. adorns the trellises that surround the garden and is a favorite food of Gulf fritillary caterpillars. The aptly named butterfly weed Asclepias tuberose, a North American native, seems to be the plant of choice for monarch caterpillars. It can be grown easily from seed and will naturalize in our Southern California gardens. Pincushion flower Scabiosa columbaria has a long blooming season. It will flower from spring through summer, if you cut off the dead flowers regularly. Yarrow Achillea sp. is one of the least demanding plants to grow in a garden. It makes a good and inexpensive plant to fill any bare edge you may have, and adult butterflies are attracted to the broad flower spikes. Salvia Salvia microphyllaxgreggii attracts both butterflies and hummingbirds; statice, or sea lavender, Limonium perezii, is a natural \"landing pad\" for butterflies. They like to sun themselves on the purple butterfly landing strip formed by the flowers.\r\n\r\nWe hope this beautiful garden with its fanciful flying visitors will inspire our two-legged visitors to plant butterfly gardens of their own.

As you amble through Scripps Aviary in Gorilla Tropics®, be sure to stop now and then to sit on the pathway benches. As you look around, you\'ll get a good feel for the flora and fauna you\'d see in an African forest—without the man-eating carnivores and poisonous snakes! The aviary even has waterfalls and gentle showers.\r\n\r\nYou\'ll notice that the trees and bushes are not trimmed and groomed like the plants on our grounds. There\'s a reason for that. Our aviary plants are extremely important for encouraging natural avian behavior, whether the birds use them for marking territories, making nests, or as special perches for courtship displays. This is why the plants and trees in all our aviaries tend to have a more natural, wilder look.\r\n\r\nThe Zoo\'s horticultural treasures are very important for our gorillas\' health and contentment. Their lush garden enclosure in Gorilla Tropics, combined with a variety of browse to snack on and play with, has led to a healthy family life for our gorilla troop, as well as plenty of baby gorillas through the years.'),
('Insect Zoo', 'San Francisco Zoo', 'http://www.sfzoo.org/images/gallery/exhibits/insectzoo/img_insectzoo_mr_large.jpg\r\n\r\nOriginally created as a temporary exhibition in 1979, our Insect Zoo proved so popular that the Zoo made it a permanent exhibit. In it, you find terrariums filled with a variety of arthropods, from our backyard and afar, including millipedes, centipedes, Madagascar hissing cockroaches, tarantulas, scorpions, velvet ants (actually a type of wasp) and termites to name a few. Be mesmerized watching our busy “bugs” — the harvester ants foraging for food and taking care of their eggs or the organized bees running the working beehive, where free-flying bees enter from outdoors through a tube leading to the indoor hive.\r\n\r\nParticipatory experiences for all ages add to the fun. Young children can burn off their excitement by climbing on the gigantic spider web outside, or slow down to enjoy insect-themed books, videos, puzzles and puppets. Older kids can get a glimpse into the science of entomology, look at specimens under a microscope, bring home a handout about butterfly gardening and even go to a “post office” to fill out a card encouraging government support for conservation that will be mailed to Washington. They also enjoy chatting with Zoo staff, especially hearing behind-the-scenes stories such as how we care for our giant thorny phasmids (walkingsticks) — mimicking their natural conditions by misting them twice a day, collecting and incubating their eggs (thought to be the largest of all insect eggs) for up to 18 months, rearing the young for another year until they are large enough to go on display, and going out every day, sometimes as far as Golden Gate Park, to collect browse for them to eat.\r\n\r\nAt scheduled times on weekends, Insect Zoo staff bring out the insects for the Incredible Insects in Action demonstration. See our amazing insects and other arthropods up-close during this fascinating demonstration. See Feedings and Presentations for the latest times.\r\n\r\nAll these offerings teach the importance of biodiversity in nature and the significance of preserving entire ecosystems.'),

The Koala Crossing exhibit, patterned after an Australian outback, is near the Australian WalkAbout exhibit. The animal staff has their hands full with five of these well-known finicky eaters.\r\n\r\nThe exhibit features an outdoor yard, where, if you look carefully, you can often see one to three koalas sitting high in the eucalyptus trees. In inclement weather, the koalas are usually kept inside their heated building, but one or two may be seen in the viewing window. Most of a koala\'s day is spent snoozing to digest its eucalyptus meals, so watching a koala may not be too exciting; however, one look our koalas’ sweet and fuzzy faces and you won\'t leave the exhibit disappointed!'),
('Leanne B. Roberts African Savanna', 'San Francisco Zoo', 'http://www.sfzoo.org/images/gallery/exhibits/savanna/img_savana_large.jpg\r\n\r\nThe dramatic three-acre, mixed-species Leanne B. Roberts African Savanna exhibit brings animals closer to the public than ever before. Entering through a covered passageway, visitors emerge within the Savanna to be surrounded by giraffe, zebra, and kudu, all living together. Many African bird species including the crowned crane, ostrich, and Marabou stork also share this open-landscaped setting. Activities that usually take place behind-the-scenes have been brought forward, allowing the visitor to view how keepers care for the animals. The exhibit, lushly planted to reflect the beauty and diversity of the savanna environment, was designed to give the animals room to interact and move about.\r\n\r\nWithin the exhibit, the African Aviary houses several critically endangered species of birds, such as the Waldrapp Ibis and the Hamerkop.\r\n\r\nAt the South Savanna Overlook, you can make a donation to support the Laikipia Predator Project which seeks to reduce conflicts between ranchers and predators in order to ensure that the region can sustainably support both human and wildlife populations.\r\n\r\nFrom the Leanne B.

('North American Desert', 'Living Desert Zoo & Gardens', 'The Living Desert features animals and plants that thrive in deserts from all around the world, including all four deserts of North America. One of the first stops on a tour through the park is the Small Animals exhibit, located on the Entrance Patio. This exhibit showcases small desert animals, many active mainly at night. Due to the extreme daytime temperatures that occur May through October, bats, scorpions, screech owls, mice, lizards and snakes all seek the coolness of the evening temperatures to hunt for food. This exhibit provides guests with an opportunity to see these elusive critters up close.'),
('Penguin Island', 'San Francisco Zoo', 'http://www.sfzoo.org/images/gallery/exhibits/penguinisl/img_penguinisland_bf_large.jpg\r\n\r\nAmong the more fascinating animals at the Zoo is the colony of Magellanic penguins located on Penguin Island across from the Lion House. These seemingly identical flightless black and white seabirds are actually very diverse in personality, disposition and markings, as the penguin keepers can attest to.\r\n\r\nExtremely social birds, Magellanic penguins can be seen \"flying\" through the water at speeds up to 15 miles per hour, basking in the sun, preening or hanging out in one of 36 burrows on the Island.\r\n\r\nWhile most people\'s image of penguins is of tuxedoed birds padding about on the ice floes of Antarctica, actually only two of the world\'s 17 species of penguins are native to the polar continent. Since Magellanic penguins inhabit the Strait of Magellan and the coastal regions of Argentina, Chile and the Falkland Islands, they are right at home in San Francisco\'s temperate, marine climate.\r\n\r\nPenguin Island has one of the most successful captive breeding colonies in the world, with 205 penguin chicks fledged since the old reflecting pool was renovated to accommodate penguins in 1984. The San Francisco Zoo participates in the Association of Zoos and Aquariums’ Species Survival Plan for the Magellanic penguin.\r\n\r\nThe 200-foot-long pool was actually built during the 1930\'s WPA construction era, and over the years has served as a reflecting pool, and later an exhibit space for squirrel monkeys, seals and even Humboldt penguins before its renovation in 1984. At that time, the central island was landscaped with 35 tons of black volcanic rock similar to that found in the penguin’s natural habitat and fitted with custom-made fiberglass burrows for the birds to use as nest sites.'),

('Reptile Mesa', 'San Diego Zoo', 'http://zoo.sandiegozoo.org/sites/default/files/animal_hero/reptileMesaT06-0464-006.jpg\r\n\r\nReptile Mesa has all kinds of exotic-looking plants (including, appropriately, dragon trees!) from all kinds of exotic locations. The task of maintaining a varied plant collection while creating natural habitats for the animal residents can be challenging. For example, in the green iguana exhibit on Reptile Mesa, the evergreen shrub, Xylosma sp., was selected because it is not a particularly flavorful plant from an iguana\'s point of view, so the lizards would not consume it as fast as we planted it, which can often occur. Moreover, this plant is sturdy enough to allow these large-bodied lizards, which can weigh up to 8 or 10 pounds (3 to 5 kilograms), to bask on top of them.\r\n\r\nAmazingly enough, Galápagos tortoises enjoy cactus now and then, whether the spines have been scraped off or not! That\'s because the spines don\'t hurt their leathery mouths, and the pads make a delicious, juicy snack. Keepers often harvest pads from the prickly pears and other cactuses on Reptile Mesa to make tortoise treats. And many of our lizards get hibiscus leaves and flowers for browse. '),

Gaze in wonder at these amazing animals from four unique vantage points. At the “nose-to-nose” viewing window, get so close you could seemingly reach out and touch them. Watch them porpoise and play from above at the “cliff overlook” or take in an animal presentation by their dedicated keepers at “the shore” while children build sand castles in the sand play area.

The new exhibit highlights environmental threats facing rainforests, as well as the devastating effects of the illegal pet trade on South American wildlife. The new Aviary will immerse visitors in a realistic tropical environment and create a stunning new educational space at the Zoo.\r\n\r\nThis renovation project transformed the historic South American Tropical Forest building which is located on the northern side of the Zoo.

You will, however, see a few non-Asian residents there, as well. Whenever the Zoo constructs a new exhibit, there are often long-standing trees that don\'t exactly fit the new bioclime\'s theme, but would be harmed if transplanted (such as, for example, a thriving macadamia from Australia). In those cases, the tree stays. Our horticulturists value the trees in their care too much to risk their health!\r\n\r\nDespite the surprises here and there, Sun Bear Forest® has a spectacular collection of Asian plants, including a number of gingers, which are actually an extension of the Ginger Garden at the base of Fern Canyon. While most people know about Zingiber officinale, the common cooking spice, many don\'t realize that there are more than 85 species of ginger in the Zingiber genus alone, and that the ginger family has about 40 additional genera.

('Tiger Trail', 'San Diego Zoo', 'http://zoo.sandiegozoo.org/sites/default/files/animal_hero/tigerTrailT08_0197_009.jpg\r\n\r\nTiger Trail, completed in 1988, brought the Zoo\'s bioclime expertise to a whole new level. A simulation of a tropical Asian rain forest, the exhibit was a huge undertaking. Its plants are watered with a custom, high-tech misting system. They have now grown to the point where they make you truly feel like you\'re walking into a jungle when you enter the trail from the lower level of the Lost Forest habitat. And the tigers, tapirs, fishing cats, and milky storks you find there seem perfectly at home in surroundings that mimic their natural habitat. '),

It opened on June 2, 1927, with 40 animals. At that time, it occupied 4.2 acres (1.7 ha), which remained the case until the early 1960s when the zoo expanded to its current 14.3 acres (5.8 ha). As of December 2012, the zoo had just over 500 animals on site.\r\n\r\nThe zoo opened as the 4.2-acre (1.7 ha) \"William Land Park Zoo\" on June 2, 1927, with 40 animals brought together from various local parks, including monkeys, raccoons, birds, and deer.[1]\r\nIn 1948, the Sacramento Union Newspaper sponsored a drive to raise money to buy the zoo an elephant. In the fall of 1949, SUE (the “Sacramento Union Elephant”), so named by local teenage sisters Jacklyn and Carolyn Bolton via a contest sponsored by the Union, arrived at the zoo, much to the delight of area visitors. In 1955, the zoo bought “Winky”, Sue’s companion.[1]\r\nThe Sacramento Zoological Society formed in 1958 to support and raise funds for the zoo as city funding began to dwindle. The year 1958 also brought along the start of the zoo’s educational programming, at that time, one of only nine zoos in the United States to have such a program. In 1997, the society took over day-to-day operation of the zoo.[1]\r\nThe zoo was expanded to 14.3 acres (5.8 ha) in the early 1960s, with new habitats built in most areas of the zoo. In 1965, the zoo received its first grizzly bear and two orangutans, and began charging 25 cents for admission. The current name was adopted in 1970, along with the completion of the reptile house and the creation of a docent program.[1]\r\nOn April 6, 2007, an exhibit featuring six penguins opened to the public. The day prior, Mayor Heather Fargo and other guests were dressed in black and white to greet the new arrivals, who were on loan for the \"one year bash\".[3]\r\nIn 2009, the zoo started construction on a new barn and yard for their giraffes. The old wooden barn was demolished and replaced with a much more spacious, heated barn. The new barn includes a breeding facility with many large stalls for current giraffes and their calves. The Tall Wonders giraffe habitat has a pavilion for visitors to get an eye to eye view of the giraffes. The new facility opened on February 12, 2010.\r\nIn 2011, brought along the grand opening of a new river otter exhibit, complete with glass that enabled visitors to walk up to visitors and interact with the very sociable North American river otters in their naturalistic habitat.[1]\r\nIn September 2014, the zoo opened Small Wonders of Africa with fennec foxes, aardvarks, fruit bats, Wolf\'s guenon, red-billed hornbill, and crested guineafowl.

Most of the exhibits were populated with animals transferred from Golden Gate Park, including two zebras, a cape buffalo, five rhesus monkeys, two spider monkeys, and three elephants (Virginia, Marjorie, and Babe).\r\nThe first exhibits built in the 1930s cost $3.5 million, which included Monkey Island, Lion House, Elephant House, a small mammal grotto, an aviary, and bear grottos. These spacious, moated enclosures were among the first bar-less exhibits in the country. In 1955, a local San Francisco newspaper purchased Pennie, a baby female Asian elephant, and donated her to the zoo after many children donated their pennies, nickels, and dimes for her purchase.'),
